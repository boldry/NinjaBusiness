# Ninja Concepts: $1.25M Raise Scenario (Debt Not Paid Off)
## Strategic Comparison: Debt Payoff vs. Debt Retention

**Date:** January 25, 2025
**Scenario:** Raise $1.25M for growth ONLY, keep $750K debt on books

---

## Executive Summary

**Key Difference:**
- **Option A:** Raise $2M (pay $750K debt + $1.25M growth) = 29% dilution
- **Option B:** Raise $1.25M (growth only, debt stays) = **20% dilution**

**Your Savings: 9% more equity = Worth $4.5M at a $50M exit**

## Part 5: Investor Perspective on Debt

### **What Investors Will Ask:**

1. **"Who are the debt holders?"**
   - Are they founders, friends/family, or institutions?
   - Do they have conversion rights?

2. **"What are the terms?"**
   - Interest rate, maturity, security
   - Any special rights or preferences?

3. **"When does it need to be repaid?"**
   - Can it wait until profitability or exit?
   - Is it callable?

4. **"Will it convert to equity?"**
   - If so, at what terms?
   - Could it dilute future investors?

5. **"What happens in a downside scenario?"**
   - Does debt get priority over equity in liquidation?
   - Could it force a fire sale?

### **Investor Preferences:**

| Investor Type | Likely Position on Debt |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| **Institutional VCs** | **Prefer clean cap table** - May require debt payoff |
| **Angel Investors** | Flexible - May accept debt if terms are clear |
| **Strategic Investors** | Case-by-case - Depends on their goals |
| **Venture Debt Funds** | Comfortable with debt - May even add more |

---

## Part 6: Recommended Structure - Best of Both Worlds

### **Hybrid Approach: $1.25M + Convertible Debt**

**Step 1: Restructure the $750K Debt**
- Convert existing debt to **Convertible Note**
- Terms: 6% interest, $10M cap, 20% discount
- Converts at Series A or exit
- **No monthly payments**

**Step 2: Raise $1.25M Equity**
- Pre-money: $5M
- Investment: $1.25M
- Post-money: $6.25M
- **Investor equity: 20%**

**Step 3: Cap Table Today**
| Stakeholder | Ownership | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Founders | 80% | Full control, clean equity |
| Seed Investors | 20% | $1.25M for growth |
| Convertible Note Holders | 0% (converts later) | $750K + 6% interest |

**Step 4: Cap Table After Series A (Example)**
Assume Series A at $20M pre-money, raise $5M:
```
Pre-conversion cap table:
- Founders: 80%
- Seed: 20%

Convertible note converts:
- $750K + 6% interest (1 year) = $795K
- With 20% discount: converts at $16M valuation
- Note gets: $795K / $16M = ~5% equity (post-conversion)

Post-note conversion, pre-Series A:
- Founders: 76% (80% × 0.95)
- Seed: 19% (20% × 0.95)
- Note holders: 5%

Series A investment: $5M at $20M pre
- Post-money: $25M
- Series A: 20%
- Everyone diluted by 20%

Final cap table:
- Founders: 60.8% (76% × 0.80)
- Seed: 15.2% (19% × 0.80)
- Note holders: 4% (5% × 0.80)
- Series A: 20%
```

## Part 7: Financial Impact Analysis

### **Scenario: $50M Exit in Year 5**

| Option | Founder % | Founder Payout | Debt Repayment | Net to Founders |
|--------|-----------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **A: $2M raise, debt paid** | 71% × 0.8 (Series A dilution) = 56.8% | $28,400,000 | $0 | **$28,400,000** |
| **B1: $1.25M raise, debt stays** | 80% × 0.8 = 64% | $32,000,000 | -$750,000 | **$31,250,000** |
| **B2: $1.25M raise, note converts** | 60.8% (per calc above) | $30,400,000 | $0 | **$30,400,000** |

**Winner: Option B1 (Debt stays, repaid at exit) = +$2.85M to founders**

---

### **Scenario: $25M Exit in Year 3**

| Option | Founder % | Founder Payout | Debt Repayment | Net to Founders |
|--------|-----------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **A: $2M raise, debt paid** | 71% | $17,750,000 | $0 | **$17,750,000** |
| **B1: $1.25M raise, debt stays** | 80% | $20,000,000 | -$750,000 | **$19,250,000** |
| **B2: $1.25M raise, note converts** | 76% (early exit, note converts) | $19,000,000 | $0 | **$19,000,000** |

**Winner: Option B1 = +$1.5M to founders**

- ✅ Institutional investors prefer this

**Cons:**
- ❌ 29% dilution (vs. 20%)
- ❌ $4.5M less at $50M exit

- ❌ Risk of default if revenue doesn't materialize
- ❌ Future investors may require it cleared anyway

---

## Part 9: Recommendation by Investor Type

### **If Raising from Institutional VCs:**
**Recommendation:** **Option A** (Raise $2M, pay debt)
- VCs strongly prefer clean cap tables
- They have capital to deploy the full $2M
- Easier to close the deal
- **Accept 29% dilution for speed and certainty**

---

### **If Raising from Angels or Strategic Investors:**
**Recommendation:** **Option B** (Raise $1.25M, restructure debt)
- Angels are more flexible
- Strategic investors focus on partnership, not cap table cleanliness
- **Restructure $750K as Convertible Note** (6% interest, $10M cap, 20% discount)
- **Accept 20% dilution + future ~5% when note converts**

---

### **If Raising from Venture Debt Funds:**
**Recommendation:** **Option B+** (Raise $1.25M equity + $750K new venture debt)
- Replace old debt with new venture debt at better terms
- Take $1.25M equity at 20% dilution
- Take $750K venture debt (12-15% interest, warrants)
- **Total: $2M capital, only 20-22% dilution**

---

## Part 10: Negotiation Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: VC Requires Debt Payoff**

**VC Says:** "We need a clean cap table. The $2M includes paying off the debt."

**Your Response:**
> "We understand. We're open to that structure. However, since $750K of the $2M goes to debt repayment rather than growth, we'd like to discuss a higher valuation to account for that. Would you consider $6M pre-money for a $2M investment? That gets you 25% instead of 29%, and we're using $750K of your capital to clean the cap table for you."

**Result:** Negotiate to $5.5M-$6M pre / 25-27% dilution

---

### **Scenario 2: Angel Investor Accepts Debt**

**Angel Says:** "The debt doesn't bother us. We're comfortable with it staying."

**Your Response:**
> "Great. That allows us to focus all $1.25M on growth. We're valuing the company at $5M pre-money, which gives you 20% for $1.25M. The existing $750K debt is structured as a convertible note that will convert at the Series A at a 20% discount, so you'll benefit from diluting that note when you invest now."

**Result:** $5M pre / 20% dilution / Clean deal

---

### **Scenario 3: Investor Wants Lower Valuation Due to Debt**

**Investor Says:** "We're concerned about the $750K debt. We'd like to invest $1.25M, but at $3.5M pre-money, not $5M."

**Your Math:**
```
$3.5M pre + $1.25M = $4.75M post
$1.25M / $4.75M = 26.3% dilution
```

**Your Response:**
> "We appreciate the offer, but that's 26% dilution for $1.25M, which is worse than taking $2M at 29% dilution and paying off the debt. If you're concerned about the debt, we'd rather structure this as $2M at $5M pre (29%) and use $750K to clear the debt. That gives you a clean cap table and we get the same economics."

**Result:** Either they accept $5M pre for $1.25M (20%), or you pivot to $2M raise at 29%

---

## Part 11: Best Path Forward

### **Recommended Strategy:**

**Step 1: Restructure Debt First (This Week)**
- Convert $750K to **Convertible Note**
- Terms: 6% interest, $10M cap, 20% discount, converts at Series A
- Get debt holders to agree (likely easy if they're friends/family/founders)

**Step 2: Pitch Both Options (Next 2 Weeks)**
- **Option A:** $2M at $5M pre (29%) - debt paid
- **Option B:** $1.25M at $5M pre (20%) - debt converts later

**Step 3: Negotiate Based on Investor Type**
- **If VC:** Expect to do Option A (29% dilution)
- **If Angel/Strategic:** Push for Option B (20% dilution)
- **If Venture Debt:** Consider hybrid structure

**Step 4: Close the Deal**
- Accept best terms from best investor
- Prioritize **founder-friendly** over **lowest dilution** if it's close

---

## Part 12: Decision Matrix

### **Choose Option A ($2M, Debt Paid) If:**
- ✅ Investor is institutional VC (they'll require it)
- ✅ You want maximum certainty of closing
- ✅ You prefer clean cap table for future fundraising
- ✅ Debt holders want equity NOW (not later)
- ✅ You can't service debt payments

### **Choose Option B ($1.25M, Debt Stays) If:**
- ✅ Investor is angel or strategic (more flexible)
- ✅ You can service debt payments or restructure as convertible
- ✅ You want to maximize founder ownership (save 9%)
- ✅ You're confident in hitting Series A in 12-18 months
- ✅ Debt holders are patient (friends/family/founders)

---

## Part 13: Final Recommendation

### **Start with Option B, Fall Back to Option A**

**Pitch:**
> "We're raising $1.25M at $5M pre-money for 20% equity. We have $750K in existing debt structured as a convertible note that will convert at the Series A. This allows all of your capital to go toward growth rather than paying off old investors."

**If Investor Pushes Back:**
> "We're flexible. If you prefer a clean cap table, we can raise $2M at $5M pre (29% equity) and use $750K to pay off the debt. Either structure works for us."

**Likely Outcome:**
- **Angels:** Accept Option B (20% dilution)
- **VCs:** Request Option A (29% dilution)
- **Strategic:** Accept Option B if partnership is strong

| **Debt Outstanding** | $0 | $750,000 (note) | Option A |
| **Cap Table Complexity** | Clean | Moderate | Option A |
| **VC Friendly** | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Maybe | Option A |
| **Value @ $50M Exit** | $35,500,000 | **$40,000,000** | **Option B** |
| **Difference** | - | **+$4,500,000** | **Option B** |

---

## **Bottom Line:**

### **Option B Saves You $4.5M at a $50M Exit**

**If you can:**
1. Restructure debt as convertible note
2. Find angel/strategic investors (not VCs)
3. Service the debt OR make it interest-only

**Then raise $1.25M at 20% dilution and keep 80% ownership.**

**If you can't, accept $2M at 29% dilution and get a clean cap table.**

---

**Next Action:**
1. Talk to your debt holders about converting to a convertible note
2. Start pitching angels/strategics with Option B
3. Keep Option A ready if VCs are your best option

This is worth fighting for—it's a $4.5M difference.
