## 5. Key Financial Metrics

### 5.1 Unit Economics

#### Ninja Notes B2B Example (From Vision Brief)

**Assumptions:**
- Average Contract Value (ACV): $3,600/year (25 users @ $12/month)
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): $1,200 (from go-to-market strategy)
- Gross Margin: 85%
- Customer Lifetime: 3 years (10% annual churn)

**Calculations:**
- **LTV (Lifetime Value):** $3,600 × 3 years × 85% margin = $9,180
- **LTV/CAC Ratio:** $9,180 / $1,200 = **7.65:1** ✅ (Target: ≥3:1)
- **CAC Payback Period:** $1,200 / ($3,600/12 × 85%) = **4.0 months** ✅ (Target: <6 months)

**Validation:** ✅ Exceeds minimum requirements (LTV/CAC >3:1, payback <6 months)

---

#### Omni Suite Enterprise Example

**Assumptions:**
- Average Contract Value (ACV): $120K/year (100 users @ $100/month Omni Sales)
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): $1,200 (enterprise sales)
- Gross Margin: 85%
- Customer Lifetime: 3 years (10% annual churn)

**Calculations:**
- **LTV:** $120K × 3 years × 85% margin = $306K
- **LTV/CAC Ratio:** $306K / $1,200 = **255:1** ✅
- **CAC Payback Period:** $1,200 / ($120K/12 × 85%) = **0.14 months** ✅

**Validation:** ✅ Excellent unit economics for enterprise segment

---

#### Weighted Average Unit Economics

**Customer Mix (Year 3):**
- Enterprise: 100 customers, $1,200 CAC, $120K ACV
- SMB: 500 customers, $200 CAC, $3,600 ACV
- B2C: 10,000 customers, $50 CAC, $120 ACV

**Weighted Average CAC:**
- (100 × $1,200 + 500 × $200 + 10,000 × $50) / 10,600 = **$75**

**Weighted Average LTV:**
- Enterprise: $306K LTV
- SMB: $9,180 LTV
- B2C: $204 LTV (2-year lifetime, 30% churn)
- Weighted: (100 × $306K + 500 × $9,180 + 10,000 × $204) / 10,600 = **$3,800**

**Weighted Average LTV/CAC:**
- $3,800 / $75 = **50.7:1** ✅

**Note:** Weighted average skewed by high-volume B2C customers. Enterprise and SMB segments have stronger unit economics.
