**Gap Description:**

- While Dale Johnson has strong product and AI ecosystem expertise, explicit engineering/technical leadership credentials need validation
- For an AI/technology company, investors typically require strong technical leadership on founding team

**Why Critical:**
- **Deal Breaker Risk:** Missing technical co-founder is a red flag for many investors in AI/technology companies
- **Execution Risk:** Technical leadership is critical for building agentic AI products, managing engineering teams, and making technical architecture decisions
- **Investor Expectations:** Ninja Concepts Venture Fund rubric and industry standards require technical co-founder or strong technical advisor

**Mitigation Plan:**
1. **Immediate (0-3 months):**
   - Validate if Dale Johnson or another team member has deep technical/engineering credentials

2. **Short-term (3-6 months):**
   - Hire VP Engineering or CTO with proven AI/ML product development experience
   - Establish technical advisory board with AI/ML experts

3. **Alternative Approach:**
   - If technical co-founder cannot be added immediately, engage strong technical advisor with meaningful equity (2-5%)
   - Technical advisor should have: AI/ML expertise, previous CTO experience, startup experience
   - Use advisor to bridge gap while recruiting technical co-founder

**Success Criteria:**
