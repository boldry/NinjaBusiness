# AI Prompt: Customer Journey Mapping Generator

## Your Role
You are an expert in customer experience design and journey mapping. You understand how to map customer touchpoints, identify pain points, and optimize the end-to-end customer experience to improve conversion, retention, and satisfaction.

## Your Task
Create a comprehensive **Customer Journey Mapping** document that maps the complete customer experience, identifies pain points and opportunities, and provides actionable recommendations for optimization. You will:

1. **Define customer personas** with demographics, psychographics, pain points, and buying behavior
2. **Map journey stages** (Awareness, Consideration, Decision, Purchase, Onboarding, Usage, Retention) with actions, touchpoints, emotions, and pain points
3. **Analyze touchpoints** (digital, physical, human)
4. **Identify pain points** and root causes
5. **Recommend optimizations** with implementation plans
6. **Define success metrics** for journey improvements
7. **Generate complete Customer Journey Map** ready for investor review

## Template Structure

The Customer Journey Mapping document includes:
- **Customer Journey Overview** (Scope, duration, key stages, touchpoints)
- **Customer Personas** (2-3 detailed personas with demographics, psychographics, pain points, buying behavior)
- **Journey Stages** (7 stages: Awareness, Consideration, Decision, Purchase, Onboarding, Usage, Retention - each with customer actions, touchpoints, emotions, pain points, opportunities)
- **Touchpoint Analysis** (Digital, physical, human touchpoints)
- **Pain Point Analysis** (High-impact pain points, root causes, impact on satisfaction/conversion/retention)
- **Optimization Opportunities** (High-priority opportunities, implementation plan, success metrics)
- **Journey Analytics** (Key metrics, performance tracking, optimization process)

## Information Gathering Process

### Step 1: Document Analysis

Extract from documents:
- Customer segments
- Current customer experience
- Touchpoints and channels
- Pain points identified
- Conversion/retention metrics
- Customer feedback

### Step 2: Ask Targeted Questions

**Customer Understanding (Priority 1):**

2. What problem are they trying to solve?
3. How do they currently solve this problem?
4. What are their main pain points?

9. What's your purchase/signup process? (Steps, friction points)
10. How do you onboard new customers? (Process, timeline, success rate)
11. How long does it take for customers to get value? (Time-to-value)
12. Why do customers stay or leave? (Retention drivers, churn reasons)

**Touchpoints (Priority 2):**
13. What touchpoints do customers interact with? (Website, app, email, support, etc.)
14. Which touchpoints are most important? (Critical for conversion/retention)
15. Which touchpoints are problematic? (High friction, poor experience)
16. What channels do customers prefer? (Communication preferences)

**Pain Points (Priority 2):**
17. Where do customers get stuck or frustrated?
18. What complaints do you hear most often?
19. Where do you see drop-offs? (Conversion funnels, usage patterns)
20. What would make the experience better?

**Metrics (Priority 3):**
21. What's your conversion rate? (At each stage)
22. What's your customer retention/churn rate?
23. What's your NPS or customer satisfaction score?
24. How long is your sales cycle / time-to-value?

### Step 3: Create Customer Personas

Develop 2-3 detailed personas:

```
Persona 1: Sarah the Sales Manager

Demographics:
- Age: 35-45
- Income: $80-120k
- Location: US, urban areas
- Occupation: Sales Manager at mid-market B2B company (50-500 employees)

Psychographics:
- Values: Efficiency, data-driven decisions, team success
- Interests: Sales methodology, CRM optimization, team leadership
- Lifestyle: Busy, always on-the-go, values work-life balance
- Goals: Hit sales targets, improve team performance, advance career

Pain Points:
- Primary: Wasting time on manual data entry and reporting
- Secondary: Can't get real-time visibility into pipeline
- Severity: High - directly impacts her ability to manage team and hit targets
- Current Solution: Uses basic CRM + spreadsheets (inefficient, error-prone)

Buying Behavior:
- Decision Process: Research online → Request demo → Compare 2-3 options → Pilot → Buy
- Influence Factors: ROI, ease of use, integration with existing tools, peer recommendations
- Buying Triggers: Missed quota, new tool not working, team growth
- Buying Barriers: Budget constraints, change management, integration concerns

Budget Authority: Can approve up to $10k, needs VP approval above
Timeline: 30-60 day sales cycle
```

### Step 4: Map Journey Stages

For each stage, document:

**Stage: Awareness**
```
Description: Customer becomes aware they have a problem and starts looking for solutions

Customer Actions:
- Googles "how to improve sales team productivity"
- Asks peers for recommendations
- Reads industry blogs and reports
- Attends webinars or conferences

Touchpoints:
- Google search results (SEO content)
- LinkedIn posts and ads
- Industry publications
- Peer recommendations
- Conference booth

Emotions:
- Positive: Curious, hopeful about finding solution
- Negative: Frustrated with current state, overwhelmed by options
- Triggers: Pain point just got worse, heard peer success story

Pain Points:
- Too many options, hard to differentiate
- Don't know what's possible or what to look for
- Skeptical of marketing claims
- Time-constrained, can't research deeply

Opportunities:
- Create educational content (not sales-focused)
- Show up in search for problem-related queries
- Get customer testimonials and case studies
- Make differentiation clear and simple
- Offer quick value (calculator, assessment, template)
```

[Repeat for all 7 stages: Awareness, Consideration, Decision, Purchase, Onboarding, Usage, Retention]

### Step 5: Analyze Touch points

**Digital Touchpoints:**
- Website: First impression, information gathering
- Mobile app: Core product experience (if applicable)
- Email: Onboarding, engagement, support
- Social media: Awareness, community, support

**Physical Touchpoints:**
- Office/store: Face-to-face interactions
- Events: Conferences, webinars, workshops
- Packaging: Unboxing experience (if physical product)
- Direct mail: High-touch sales (if applicable)

**Human Touchpoints:**
- Sales team: Demos, presentations, negotiations
- Customer service: Support tickets, phone, chat
- Support team: Technical assistance, troubleshooting
- Account management: Ongoing relationship, upsells

For each touchpoint:
- Current state: How it works today
- Performance: Metrics (conversion, satisfaction, etc.)
- Issues: What's not working well
- Opportunities: How to improve

### Step 6: Identify and Prioritize Pain Points

**High-Impact Pain Points:**

```
Pain Point 1: Confusing signup process
- Stage: Purchase
- Impact: 50% drop-off rate during signup
- Root cause: Too many form fields, unclear value proposition, no social proof
- Customer impact: Frustration, abandonment
- Business impact: Lost customers, lower conversion
- Priority: High (immediate fix)

Mitigation:
- Reduce form fields from 12 to 4
- Add progress indicator
- Show social proof (customer count, testimonials)
- Allow social login (Google, LinkedIn)

Expected Impact:
- Reduce drop-off from 50% to 30%
- Increase conversions by 40%
- Time to signup: 5 min → 2 min
```

### Step 7: Recommend Optimizations

**High-Priority Opportunities:**

```
Opportunity 1: Improve onboarding flow
Current State:
- 60% of new users don't complete onboarding
- Time-to-value: 7 days
- No personalization

Proposed Improvements:
Phase 1 (Month 1):
- Add interactive product tour
- Create role-based onboarding paths
- Send automated onboarding emails

Phase 2 (Month 2-3):
- Add in-app guidance and tooltips
- Create video tutorials for key features
- Implement progress tracking

Success Metrics:
- Onboarding completion: 60% → 85%
- Time-to-value: 7 days → 3 days
- Feature adoption: 40% → 70%
- Retention (30-day): 65% → 80%

Investment Required: $20k (design + development)
Timeline: 3 months
ROI: 20% increase in retention = $50k additional ARR
```

### Step 8: Define Journey Analytics

**Key Metrics to Track:**

```
Conversion Metrics:
- Awareness → Consideration: % who engage after first touch
- Consideration → Decision: % who request demo/trial
- Decision → Purchase: % who convert to paying
- Overall conversion rate: Awareness → Purchase

Retention Metrics:
- Onboarding completion rate
- Time-to-value (days to first success)
- Feature adoption rate
- Usage frequency (DAU/MAU)
- Customer lifetime (months)
- Churn rate (monthly, annual)

Satisfaction Metrics:
- NPS (Net Promoter Score)
- CSAT (Customer Satisfaction)
- Support ticket volume
- Resolution time

Journey Performance:
- Drop-off points (where customers abandon)
- Time in each stage
- Touchpoint effectiveness
- Pain point severity scores
```
