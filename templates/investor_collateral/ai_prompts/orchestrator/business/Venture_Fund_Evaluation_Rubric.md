## Equity Calculation Methodology

### Formula

```
Total Value Delivered = Cash Investment + Service Savings + Shared Resources

Where:
  Service Savings = (Service Spend @ Market Rate) - (Service Spend @ Ninja Rate)
  Service Spend = Cash Investment × Service Utilization %
  Market Rate = Ninja Rate × 2.5 (conservative multiplier)
  Ninja Rate = Cost + 15%
  Shared Resources = $40k/year × 1.5 years = $60k
```

### Service Utilization Estimation

Estimate service utilization based on:

**High Utilization (30-40%)**:
- Building product from scratch
- Need heavy design, development, architecture
- Technical co-founder gap
- Complex compliance/legal requirements

**Medium Utilization (20-25%)**:
- Existing MVP, needs scaling
- Some technical team in place
- Standard development needs
- Moderate operational support

**Low Utilization (10-15%)**:
- Established product and team
- Optimization and enhancement focus
- Strategic initiatives only
- Limited new development

### Calculation Worksheet

Use this for each deal evaluation:

```
1. Cash Investment Amount: $__________

2. Estimated Service Utilization %: ________%

3. Service Spend:
   = Cash Investment × Utilization %
   = $__________ × _____%
   = $__________

4. Market Rate Service Cost:
   = Service Spend × (2.5 / 1.15)
   = $__________ × 2.17
   = $__________

5. Service Savings:
   = Market Cost - Service Spend
   = $__________ - $__________
   = $__________

6. Shared Resources Value (18 months):
   = $60k (fixed)

7. Total Value to Venture:
   = Cash + Service Savings + Shared Resources
   = $__________ + $__________ + $60k
   = $__________

8. Target Equity Based on Tier:
   - Tier 1 (Idea): 38-45%
   - Tier 2 (Validated): 28-35%
   - Tier 3 (Revenue): 20-26%

9. Recommended Equity: ________%

## Appendix: Example Deal Evaluations

### Example 1: AI-Powered Sales Intelligence Platform (Tier 2)

**Company Profile:**
- Stage: Pre-revenue, working MVP
- Market: B2B SaaS, sales intelligence
- TAM: $8B, growing 25% YoY
- Team: 3 founders (2 technical, 1 GTM), prior startup experience
- Traction: 15 pilot customers, 5 LOIs worth $150k ARR

**Scoring:**
- Market: 18/20 (9 base × 2 portfolio synergy)
- Moat: 11/15 (8 base + 3 proprietary data)
- Team: 15/20 (8 base × 1.5 prior startup experience)
- Product: 9/15 (solid beta product)
- Traction: 8/15 (good LOIs, no revenue yet)
- Financial: 7/10 (strong model, unvalidated)
- Synergy: 4/5 (high - complements portfolio)
- **Total: 72/100** → **YES, proceed**

**Investment Proposal:**
- Tier: 2 (Validated)
- Cash: $750k
- Service Utilization: 25% ($187.5k)
- Service Market Value: $407k
- Service Savings: $220k
- Shared Resources: $60k
- **Total Value: $1.03M**
- **Equity: 30%**
- Implied Valuation: $3.4M post-money

**Rationale:**
Strong market fit with portfolio, good team, early validation. Service-heavy needs (product scaling) align well with Ninja capabilities. 30% equity justified by total value delivered and growth potential.

---

### Example 2: Consumer FinTech App (Tier 1)

**Company Profile:**
- Stage: Concept with technical prototype
- Market: Consumer fintech, personal finance
- TAM: $12B, growing 35% YoY
- Team: 2 founders (technical + finance background)
- Traction: 200 beta testers, no revenue

**Scoring:**
- Market: 10/20 (10 base × 1 no synergy)
- Moat: 7/15 (6 base + 1 switching costs)
- Team: 8/20 (6 base × 1.3 technical strength)
- Product: 5/15 (early prototype)
- Traction: 3/15 (users but no paying customers)
- Financial: 5/10 (model exists, unvalidated)
- Synergy: 1/5 (low - outside core portfolio)
- **Total: 39/100** → **NO, pass**

**Rationale:**
While market is strong, low portfolio synergy, limited traction, and consumer focus (vs B2B preference) make this a poor fit. Team is unproven. Below minimum threshold of 65.

**Company Profile:**
- Stage: $800k ARR, strong growth
- Market: B2B SaaS, developer tools
- TAM: $6B, growing 30% YoY

- Team: 20/20 (10 base × 2 prior exit)
- Product: 14/15 (production system, proven scale)
- Traction: 18/15 (13 base + 3 unit economics + 2 retention)
- Financial: 10/10 (proven model)
- Synergy: 5/5 (very high - all portfolio companies need this)
- **Total: 96/100** → **STRONG YES**

**Investment Proposal:**
- Tier: 3 (Revenue)
- Cash: $1M
- Service Utilization: 10% ($100k)
- Service Market Value: $217k
- Service Savings: $117k
- Shared Resources: $60k
- **Total Value: $1.177M**
- **Equity: 24%**
- Implied Valuation: $4.9M post-money

**Rationale:**
Exceptional opportunity with proven traction, strong team, and massive portfolio synergy (every company can use this). Service needs are lower (primarily optimization), but savings and strategic value justify 24% equity. Fast track to investment committee.
