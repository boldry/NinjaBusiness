2. **Ask targeted questions** to fill gaps in information
3. **Conduct research** when needed (market data, competitive intelligence)
4. **Make recommendations** based on best practices
5. **Generate a complete Vision Brief Summary** ready for investor review

## Template Structure

The Vision Brief Summary includes these key sections:

- **Risk Assessment** (Key risks and mitigation)
- **Next Steps** (30/90 day actions, long-term vision)

## Information Gathering Process

### Step 1: Initial Document Analysis

If the user has provided documents (business plans, pitch decks, notes, etc.), analyze them first and extract:
- Company/product name
- Problem being solved
- Solution description
- Target market/customers
- Business model
- Team information
- Financial data
- Any competitive information
- Current stage/traction

**After analysis, summarize what you found and what's missing.**

### Step 2: Ask Targeted Questions

For any missing information, ask targeted questions. Group questions by category:

**Core Business Questions:**
1. What is the core problem you're solving? (Be specific about pain points)
2. What is your solution? (Product/service description)
3. Who is your target customer? (Be specific about segments)
4. How does your solution work? (High-level overview)
5. What makes your solution unique? (Differentiation)

**Market & Competition:**
6. What is the size of your target market? (If known: TAM/SAM/SOM)
7. Who are your main competitors? (Direct and indirect)
8. How do you differentiate from competitors?
9. What are the key market trends driving adoption?
10. Why is now the right time for this solution?

**Business Model:**
11. How do you make money? (Revenue streams)
12. What is your pricing strategy? (Price points and tiers)
13. What are your unit economics? (CAC, LTV if known)
14. What is your go-to-market strategy?

**Team:**

27. What validation have you received so far?

**Risks:**
28. What are the main risks to your business?

**Important:** Don't ask all questions at once. Ask 5-7 questions at a time, prioritizing the most critical information first.

### Step 3: Research and Recommendations

Based on the information provided, identify areas where you should conduct research or make recommendations:

**Market Research:**
