| **Commitment Level** | 10 | 1.5 | All co-founders full-time, clear leadership roles |
| **Team Completeness** | 7 | 0.7 | 8 FTEs, key roles filled, but needs sales/marketing hires |

**Category 2 Total: 6.85 / 20**
*Rationale: Solid team with commitment, but lacks proven exits and deep network. First-time studio founders.*

## Part 2: Score Interpretation

### Decision Matrix

| Score Range | Recommendation | Ninja Concepts Score |
|-------------|----------------|----------------------|
| 85-100 | STRONG GO | |
| 70-84 | GO | |
| 55-69 | CONDITIONAL | |
| **40-54** | **HOLD** | **47.1** ✓ |
| 0-39 | NO GO | |

**Assessment:** HOLD / CONDITIONAL

This is a **borderline opportunity** that falls into the "HOLD" category due to:
- ❌ **Pre-revenue** (no proven unit economics)
- ❌ **First-time studio founders** (no track record of exits)
- ❌ **High execution risk** (ambitious multi-product strategy)
- ❌ **Competitive market** (6+ established players)

However, there are **strong positives**:
- ✅ **Massive TAM** ($1T+ market)
- ✅ **Unique positioning** (studio + products + compliance)
- ✅ **Products in beta** (tangible progress for $750K spent)
- ✅ **Committed team** (8 FTEs, full-time founders)

---

## Part 3: Valuation & Equity Calculation

### Scenario Analysis

#### **Scenario A: Conservative Valuation** (HOLD stage, pre-revenue)

**Pre-Money Valuation:** $1.5M - $2M
- Rationale: 2-3x capital deployed ($750K), pre-revenue, high risk
- Comparable: Pre-revenue SaaS companies typically valued at 2-4x raised capital

**Calculation:**
```
Pre-Money: $2M
Investment: $2M
Post-Money: $4M
Investor Equity: $2M / $4M = 50%
```

**Result:** **40-50% equity**

---

#### **Scenario B: Market Standard Valuation** (CONDITIONAL stage, near commercialization)

**Pre-Money Valuation:** $3M - $4M
- Rationale: Products built, beta users, team assembled, beginning sales
- Comparable: Seed-stage B2B SaaS with working product but no revenue

**Calculation:**
```
Pre-Money: $3.5M
Investment: $2M
Post-Money: $5.5M
Investor Equity: $2M / $5.5M = 36.4%
```

**Result:** **33-40% equity**

---

#### **Scenario C: Optimistic Valuation** (Strong team discount)

**Pre-Money Valuation:** $5M - $6M
- Rationale: Experienced team, multiple products, venture studio model
- Comparable: Seed+ companies with strong founder pedigrees

**Calculation:**
```
Pre-Money: $5M
Investment: $2M
Post-Money: $7M
Investor Equity: $2M / $7M = 28.6%
```

**Result:** **25-30% equity**

---

### **Recommended Valuation Range**

| Valuation Scenario | Pre-Money | Post-Money | Equity % | Justification |
|-------------------|-----------|------------|----------|---------------|
| **Floor** | $1.5M | $3.5M | 57% | Pre-revenue, high risk, borderline score |
| **Base Case** | $3M | $5M | 40% | Standard seed valuation, products in beta |
| **Ceiling** | $5M | $7M | 29% | Optimistic, based on team + multi-product |

---

## Part 4: Recommended Investment Terms

### **Base Recommendation: $3M Pre-Money Valuation**

**Investment:** $2M
**Post-Money Valuation:** $5M
**Investor Equity:** 40%
**Founder/Team Equity (post-round):** 60%

### **Rationale:**

1. **Market Standard:** Typical seed-stage B2B SaaS pre-revenue valuation is 3-5x capital raised
2. **Risk Adjustment:** Pre-revenue + execution risk + competitive market = lower end of range
3. **Asset Value:** 3 products built + 8-person team + IP = tangible value created
4. **Debt Conversion:** $750K of the $2M goes to debt repayment (not dilutive to founders vs. debt holders)

---

### **Use of Funds Breakdown**

| Category | Amount | % | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---|---------|
| **Debt Repayment** | $750K | 37.5% | Pay back existing investor loans/debt |
| **Product Development** | $400K | 20% | Complete Omni Suite, enhance Ninja Notes |
| **Sales & Marketing** | $500K | 25% | Hire 2 sales reps, marketing campaigns, lead gen |
| **Key Hires** | $250K | 12.5% | Product manager, customer success, 1 engineer |
| **Operations & Infrastructure** | $100K | 5% | Compliance (SOC 2/ISO), tools, infrastructure |

**Total: $2M**

---

## Part 5: Investor Protections & Terms

### **Recommended Term Sheet Structure**

**Security Type:** Convertible Preferred Stock (Series Seed)

**Key Terms:**

| Term | Value | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| **Liquidation Preference** | 1x non-participating | Investor gets $2M back first in exit, then pro-rata |
| **Anti-Dilution** | Weighted average | Standard protection against down rounds |
| **Board Seats** | 1 of 3 (Investor, Founder, Independent) | Investor oversight without control |
| **Milestones for Tranche 2** | Optional $500K at $1M ARR | De-risk execution with milestone-based funding |
| **Vesting** | 4-year founder vesting (1-year cliff) | Align long-term commitment |
| **Option Pool** | 10-15% reserved | Future employee equity |

---

### **Milestone-Based Alternative Structure**

To reduce risk, consider **tranched investment**:

**Tranche 1:** $1.5M immediately (for debt + operations + initial hires)
**Tranche 2:** $500K at milestones:
- Achieve $50K MRR OR
- 50 paying customers OR
- Complete SOC 2 Type II certification

This protects the investor from execution failure while giving the company sufficient capital to achieve initial validation.

---

## Part 6: Risk Mitigation Requirements

### **Success Metrics (18-Month Targets)**

| Metric | Target | Stretch Goal |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **MRR** | $50K | $100K |
| **Customers** | 50 paying | 100 paying |
| **Ventures Launched** | 2 co-builds | 4 co-builds |

---

## Part 7: Expected Returns Analysis

### **Exit Scenarios (5-7 year horizon)**

| Scenario | Exit Value | Investor Return (40% stake) | Multiple |
|----------|------------|----------------------------|----------|
| **Base Case** | $25M acquisition | $10M | 5x |
| **Success Case** | $50M acquisition | $20M | 10x |
| **Home Run** | $100M+ (IPO path) | $40M+ | 20x+ |
| **Failure** | $0 (shutdown) | $0 | 0x |

**Probability-Weighted Return:**
```
Expected Value = (0.15 × $0) + (0.35 × $10M) + (0.40 × $20M) + (0.10 × $40M)
               = $0 + $3.5M + $8M + $4M
               = $15.5M on $2M investment
               = 7.75x expected return
```

**Risk-Adjusted IRR:** ~28-32% (assumes 6-year exit)

---

## Part 8: Final Recommendation

### **Investment Decision: CONDITIONAL YES**

**Recommended Terms:**
- **Investment Amount:** $2M
- **Valuation:** $3M pre-money / $5M post-money
- **Equity Stake:** 40%
- **Structure:** Series Seed Preferred with 1x liquidation preference
- **Alternative:** $1.5M + $500K milestone tranche

---

### **Why 40% Equity is Fair**

1. **Market Comp:** Standard for pre-revenue seed stage ($3M pre-money)
2. **Risk Premium:** Pre-revenue status = higher equity for risk
3. **Execution Uncertainty:** First-time studio, no proven GTM
4. **Debt Repayment:** $750K (37.5%) goes to debt, effectively reduces dilution impact
5. **Board Control:** Investor gets governance rights to de-risk execution

---

### **Why This Is Still Attractive for Founders**

1. **Retain Majority:** Founders keep 60% (control threshold)
2. **Debt Cleared:** $750K debt converted to equity (clean cap table)
3. **Sufficient Capital:** $1.25M for growth is meaningful runway (12-18 months)
4. **Upside Preserved:** 60% of a $50M exit = $30M vs. 100% of $0M
5. **Validation:** $3M valuation pre-revenue is respectable for first-time founders

---

### **Red Flags to Address Before Closing**

1. ❗ **No Revenue:** Delay closes risk if sales don't materialize
2. ❗ **Competitive Pressure:** Similar products launching monthly
3. ❗ **Multi-Product Complexity:** Risk of unfocused execution
4. ❗ **First-Time Studio:** No proven venture-building track record
5. ❗ **Prior Capital Audit:** Need transparency on $750K deployment

---

### **Next Steps**

**For Ninja Concepts:**
1. Complete financial audit of $750K deployed
2. Prepare detailed 18-month milestones and budget
3. Provide customer pipeline and LOI evidence
4. Draft term sheet with legal counsel
5. Prepare data room for due diligence

**For Investors:**
1. Conduct technical due diligence on products
2. Reference checks on founding team
3. Validate market assumptions with industry experts
4. Review competitive landscape in detail
5. Negotiate board seat and protective provisions
