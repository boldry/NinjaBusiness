## Part 2: Equity Calculation Framework

### **Base Equity Calculation**

```
Total Value Contributed by Ninja Concepts = Cash Investment + Sweat Equity Value

Sweat Equity Value = (Operational Costs × Time Allocation %) + Services Value

Base Equity % = Total Value Contributed / Post-Money Valuation
```

### **Step 1: Calculate Ninja Concepts Contribution**

#### **Cash Investment**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Development budget (Phase 2-3) | $_______ |
| Marketing/GTM budget (Phase 4) | $_______ |
| Operational support (Phase 5, Year 1) | $_______ |
| **Total Cash Investment** | **$_______** |

#### **Sweat Equity Valuation**
| Service | Market Rate | Months | Value |
|---------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Product Management | $15K/mo | ___ | $_______ |
| Technical Architecture | $20K/mo | ___ | $_______ |
| Development Services | $50K/mo | ___ | $_______ |
| Marketing/GTM Strategy | $15K/mo | ___ | $_______ |
| Operations Setup | $10K/mo | ___ | $_______ |
| **Total Sweat Equity** | | | **$_______** |

**Total Ninja Concepts Contribution** = Cash + Sweat = **$_______**

### **Step 2: Calculate SME Contribution**

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Domain expertise & network access | $_______ (typically $50K-$200K) |
| Customer access/LOIs (value of pipeline) | $_______ |
| IP/existing assets contributed | $_______ |
| Cash investment by SME | $_______ |
| SME time commitment (hours × $200/hr) | $_______ |
| **Total SME Contribution** | **$_______** |

### **Step 3: Determine Pre-Money Valuation**

Use market comps and venture studio standard:
```
Pre-Money Valuation = 5x Total Expected Contributions
                     = 5 × (Ninja Contribution + SME Contribution)
                     = 5 × ($_______ + $_______)
                     = $_______
```

**Alternative method** (if market validation exists):
```
Pre-Money Valuation = Annual Revenue × Industry Multiple
                     OR
                     = DCF based on 5-year projections with 30% discount rate
```

### **Step 4: Calculate Equity Stakes**

```
Post-Money Valuation = Pre-Money + Total Cash Invested

Ninja Equity % = (Cash Investment + Sweat Equity) / Post-Money Valuation

SME Equity % = SME Contribution / Post-Money Valuation

Employee Option Pool = 15-20% (reserved for future hires)
```

### **Example Calculation**

**Scenario:**
- Ninja cash investment: $375K
- Ninja sweat equity: $375K (6 months dev, 3 months GTM)
- Total Ninja: $750K
- SME contribution: $150K (network + time)
- Pre-money valuation: 5 × ($750K + $150K) = $4.5M
- Post-money valuation: $4.5M + $375K cash = $4.875M

**Equity Split:**
- Ninja Concepts: $750K / $4.875M = **15.4%**
- SME: $150K / $4.875M = **3.1%**
- Option Pool: **15%**
- **SME post-pool**: ~81.5% (after dilution)

### **Venture Studio Standard Ranges**

Based on market research:
| Ninja Contribution | Typical Equity Range | Notes |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Cash only (<$250K) | 10-20% | Lower end, SME does execution |
| Cash + Light sweat ($250K-$750K) | 20-35% | Shared execution model |
| Cash + Full execution ($750K-$1.5M) | 35-50% | Ninja Concepts leads build |
| Cash + Execution + IP ($1.5M+) | 50-80% | Studio-originated concept |

### **Step 5: Equity Adjustment Factors**

Apply multipliers to base equity:

| Factor | Multiplier | Justification |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| **High-risk venture** (Score 40-55) | +10-15% | Compensate for higher failure probability |
| **SME weak on execution** | +10-20% | Ninja takes more execution burden |
| **No market validation** | +5-10% | Higher early-stage risk |
| **Competitive intensity** (6+ competitors) | +5% | Harder path to success |
| **Strong SME network** (clear customer access) | -5% | De-risk market entry |
| **Proven revenue** (existing customers) | -5-10% | Lower risk |
| **SME cash investment** (material amount) | -5-10% | Skin in the game |

**Adjusted Equity % = Base Equity % × (1 + Adjustment Factors)**

## Part 3: Return Analysis

### **Target Returns**

| Investment Stage | Target IRR | Target MOIC | Typical Timeline |
|------------------|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| Pre-seed / Idea stage | 35-50% | 10-20x | 5-7 years |
| Seed stage | 25-40% | 5-10x | 4-6 years |
| Early traction | 20-30% | 3-5x | 3-5 years |

### **Expected Value Calculation**

```
Expected Value = (Exit Value × Ninja Equity % × Success Probability) - Investment

Where:
- Exit Value = Projected revenue Year 5 × Industry Multiple
- Success Probability = Based on stage and risk assessment
  - Pre-seed: 10-20%
  - Seed with validation: 20-30%
  - Traction: 30-40%
```

### **Example:**
```
Exit Value: $50M (Year 5 revenue $10M × 5x multiple)
Ninja Equity: 25%
Success Probability: 20%
Investment: $750K

Expected Value = ($50M × 0.25 × 0.20) - $750K = $2.5M - $750K = $1.75M
Expected ROI = $1.75M / $750K = 2.33x return
Risk-Adjusted IRR = ~18%
```

**Decision:** If risk-adjusted IRR < 25%, either:
1. Increase equity stake
2. Reduce investment/sweat equity
3. Pass on opportunity
