## Organizational & Cultural Development

- Instituted more regular, structured dev catchups (modeled on sales calls) to improve alignment and transparency on all dev areas..
- Began reducing "tribal knowledge" by pushing systematic documentation of processes and roles.

- Need to start the work on full delivery and support models -- currently our maturity here is low and a risk for the company.
