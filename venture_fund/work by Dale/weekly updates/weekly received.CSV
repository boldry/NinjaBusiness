"Re: Quote Request - Two AI Product MVPs (MOMeaze App + WisdomOS Platform)","Hey Dale and Bo,


Great call Wednesday and we're excited to get started. 


During our conversation, we covered several key points:

*	MOMeaze Project Development Strategy: We aligned on a two-phase approach for the Mommies project, starting with a Proof of Concept (POC) by January for investor meetings and Kickstarter, followed by a full MVP for Mother's Day release, with a strong emphasis on modular and adaptable code architecture.
*	MSA Confirmation: We discussed the need for final confirmation on the Master Services Agreement (MSA) edit, which is crucial for moving forward with all projects. (done!)
*	Wisdom Project & Funding Estimates: We covered the need for a ""SWAG"" estimate for the Wisdom project, as well as other upcoming projects, to support Ninjaconcepts' $15M funding raise.

Here are the next steps we agreed upon:

	Subject: Re: Quote Request - Two AI Product MVPs (MOMeaze App + WisdomOS Platform)

	 

	Hey Dale and Bo,

	 

	Great call yesterday. We're excited about MOMeaze. Let's make it happen. 

	 

	We covered several key points during our discussion:

	*	Kayla's vision for the MOMeaze project, including the Mother's Day launch goal and the strategic focus on a Proof of Concept (POC). We'll need to start asap. 
	*	An overview of BairesDev's dedicated team model, our discovery phase approach, and the flexibility offered by time and materials engagements.
	*	Initial discussions regarding the Master Service Agreement (MSA) and the introduction of potential future projects such as QA automation and Wisdom OS. (QA Role and MOMeaze immediate needs, Wisdom trailing a bit behind)
	*	We reviewed the sole MSA edit your team had for Section 2.1. (I had a chance to review this with my team already this morning and for this clause, you are able to cancel if we Breach the contract, we just have a 15 day ""cure"" period to attempt to solve the breached issue. If we can't, you can walk away regardless of the minimum engagement duration. The exact language is under 2.1 - Termination for Breach. This should cover you in case we completely mess up and don't provide what we are supposed to) If you're good with that, can we route MSA for signature while we continue defining SOW?
	*	We also discussed timetracker concerns, which I can address further, waiting on a specific answer internally then I can share

	Regarding our next steps, we will proceed as follows:

	*	For times to meet today, I can only connect at 12pm CST today. I can also meet at 1:30pm CST on Wednesday. I'd suggest Wednesday so 1. Conor can join and 2. We'll make a bit more progress on our side and provide firm rates and lead times to get started
	*	Once we have the SOW signed we can begin planning the Design Phase Kickoff in Houston near Kayla. 

	 

	Best,

	Brandon

					Subject: Re: Quote Request - Two AI Product MVPs (MOMeaze App + WisdomOS Platform) 

					 

					Hey Dale,

					 

					Confirming received. Thanks for sharing. 

					 

					During our conversation, we covered several important topics:

					*	The shift in focus from the Ninja Notes application to two new project ideas: ""MomEaze"" and ""WisdomOS.""
					*	The need for rapid turnaround onbudgetary estimates and enhanced NDA controls for highly unique project concepts.
					*	We'd like to begin getting an MSA/SOW reviewed so we can move quickly on projects Ninja Concepts chooses BairesDev to support. (I will share this by tomorrow) My Vp, @Conor Edward Mccann <mailto:conor.mccann@bairesdev.com>  can help expedite the MSA conversations and we suggest meeting for a call this week to talk through this

					 

					To ensure we move forward efficiently, here are the agreed-upon next steps:

					*	You will send the documents for the MomEaze and Wisdom OS project ideas to me and Melissa. (already shared!)
					*	I will share the documentation we discussed during the meeting with you. (See below) 
					*	Melissa, Conor and myself debriefed after our meeting Friday and would also like to present a standardized rate card for BairesDev that you can use to mix and match requirements and expedite proposal delivery. We can review this and MSA redlines together with @Conor Edward Mccann <mailto:conor.mccann@bairesdev.com> . Could we connect at 11am CST on Friday for this?

					Best,

					Brandon

					Kestrel — MVP Executive Summary
					What Kestrel is
					A drone‑imagery and ML platform for residential roofing contractors. Kestrel turns drone photos into point clouds, extracts roof polygons (facets, eaves, ridges, pitch), detects damage, and auto‑generates a bill of materials (BOM) and crew work orders. Translation: faster bids, safer ops, fewer over‑/under‑orders—plus homeowner‑friendly visuals that help close deals. No more roof parkour.
					Why now
					Roofing is a huge, fragmented market with low tech penetration. Existing aerial imagery is periodic and lower resolution; on‑demand drones deliver fresher, higher‑fidelity data. We’re already proving the workflow inside CarbonBlack, giving Kestrel real‑world credibility out of the gate.
________________________________

					Product & Technology

					*	
						Core engines
					
					

					*	
						Measurement model: 3D reconstruction and polygon extraction (areas, lengths, pitch).
					*	
						Damage detection: hail, lifted shingles, cracks; optionally thermal.
					*	
						Materials model: converts measurements to an itemized BOM for ordering and production.
					
					

					*	
						Capture‑agnostic ingestion
					
					

					*	
						Contractor flies their own drone and uploads.
					*	
						3rd‑party network (e.g., pilot marketplaces) dispatched via Kestrel.
					*	
						Kestrel area capture (future): systematic neighborhood/region flights building a licensable imagery/data library.
					
					

					*	
						Build approach
					Use off‑the‑shelf frameworks where practical; train proprietary models and pipelines for roofing‑specific accuracy and robustness.
					
					

________________________________

					Target Customer & Initial Scope

					*	
						Beachhead: U.S. residential roofing contractors (replacement/repair).
					*	
						Why this wedge: High volume, repeatable workflow, clear ROI in sales (win‑rate lift) and production (waste reduction).
					*	
						Adjacencies (later): siding, gutters, windows; international markets where aerial coverage is thin.
					
					

________________________________

					Defensible Advantages

					*	
						Data quality & recency: on‑demand drone imagery beats periodic flyovers for resolution and timeliness.
					*	
						End‑to‑end workflow: measurements + damage + BOM in one system; contractor‑first UX.
					*	
						Proven in the wild: actively used at CarbonBlack for material ordering and work orders.
					*	
						Flexible capture: works with any modern drone and accepts 3rd‑party pilot data; future “imagery‑as‑a‑service” option.
					
					

________________________________

					Go‑to‑Market & Timeline

					*	
						90–120 days: onboard first paying contractors; convert internal CarbonBlack learnings into external MVP.
					*	
						Channels: direct outreach to mid‑size contractors; industry associations & events; integrations with roofing CRMs/estimators; potential distributor/manufacturer partnerships.
					*	
						Geography: start U.S. regions with high storm/hail activity and dense housing stock; expand as references accumulate.
					
					

________________________________

					Business Model (to be validated with pilots)

					*	
						Per‑project fee (easy trial, pass‑through in estimates).
					*	
						SaaS subscription (tiers by usage; API access at higher tiers).
					*	
						Licensing/data access (future): monetize area‑capture imagery and derived roof data to contractors/insurers/solar.
					
					

					Pricing will be tested to capture a portion of quantified ROI: faster bids, higher close rates, fewer material overruns, safer operations.
________________________________

					Market Opportunity (from the source doc)

					*	
						U.S. roofing spend: tens of billions annually; ~100k contractor businesses.
					*	
						Drone inspection segment projected to grow double‑digits over the decade; mature comps (e.g., aerial measurement incumbents) demonstrate large revenue/valuation headroom.
					*	
						Illustrative revenue path (for intuition, not guidance): at 100k reports/year @ $100 each → $10M ARR in U.S. alone, before subscriptions, international, or adjacent trades.
					
					

________________________________

					Use of Funds (6-Month Runway)
					Headline target: ~$650,000 total to deliver an external MVP, secure first paying customers, and demonstrate investor-grade proof points.
					High-Level Allocation

					*	
						Team & Salaries: $431,000
					*	
						Infrastructure & Tools: $70,000
					*	
						Legal / Admin / Insurance: $23,000
					*	
						Marketing, Sales, & Pilot Programs: $45,000
					*	
						Contingency & Working Reserve: $25,000
					Total: ≈ $650,000
					
					

					Sanity Check & Flexibility
					The detailed model fully utilizes the $650K runway.
					If future conditions require tightening to the $550–600K range, the plan can flex in two low-risk ways:

					1.	
						Phase non-critical hires — start Frontend or Customer Success in month 3, reducing spend by $50–70K.
					Fractional or contractor adjustments — use part-time marketing and photogrammetry support, saving $20–30K.

					Capitalization & Governance
					Participants & roles

					*	
						Ninja Concepts (incubator & seed capital)
					*	
						Jim Johnson (CSO; Strategic)
					*	
						Cory Shelton (Co‑founder & CEO)
					*	
						Jory Allen (Co‑founder & COO)

________________________________

					120‑Day Milestones & KPIs
					Build

					*	
						External MVP: upload → process → measurements + BOM + shareable report.
					*	
						Accuracy gates: ±2–3% area error vs manual/aerial, >95% auto‑segmentation pass rate on typical roofs.
					*	
						Cycle time: <15 minutes from upload to report (commodity GPU).
					
					

					Commercial

					*	
						5–10 pilot contractors live; ≥50 paid reports processed.
					*	
						Case studies quantifying: bid speedup, close‑rate lift, material over/under‑order reduction.
					*	
						First integrations (CRM/estimator) or distributor/manufacturer referral pilot.
					
					

					Metrics to track
					Report throughput, average turnaround, % auto vs manual review, BOM variance vs actuals, pilot‑to‑paid conversion, gross margin per report, churn/retention for early subs.
________________________________

					Key Risks & Mitigations

					*	
						Edge‑case roofs (complex geometry, occlusions): staged QA workflow; human‑in‑the‑loop for exceptions; targeted data collection.
					*	
						FAA & ops logistics: standardize Part‑107 compliance; lean on 3rd‑party pilot networks early; clear SOPs.
					*	
						Contractor adoption friction: zero‑install uploader, hands‑on onboarding, quick‑win visuals for sales reps.
					*	
						Compute costs: batch/spot GPUs, model distillation, caching, pricing that scales with value delivered.
					
					

________________________________

					The Ask (What this plan funds)

					*	
						Runway: 6 months to external MVP, early revenue, strong reference customers.
					*	
						Team: lean core (ML, backend, frontend, photogrammetry, GTM) plus fractional support.
					*	
						Proof: measurable ROI for contractors and repeatable go‑to‑market motion.
					
					

________________________________

					Open Items to Lock

					1.	
						Capitalization and Governance
					2.	
						Finalize hire phasing to align the detailed budget with the $550–600k target.
					3.	
						Pick two pricing experiments for pilots (e.g., $/report vs. tiered SaaS).

					Confirm pilot geographies and 3–5 lighthouse customers.

"RE: A few more follow up questions","Dale,

 

The agreements are dense, but generally fair from a legal standpoint.  I cannot perform a commercial fairness check.

 

Here are a few highlights to the revisions I have made:

 

1.	Indemnities – the biggest issue for me.  If they expect us to indemnify them, they need to indemnify us reciprocally.  Especially for Security Breaches.  If we give them a password, and they use poor security on their own passwords (like post-in notes floating around an office), that’s on them, and not on us.  If their email gets hacked, that’s on them, and not on us.
2.	Fees – if they want to terminate for convenience, they need to pay use some form of terminate fee.
3.	Transition Services – we don’t work for free.  If they want to transition, then they need to pay for that transition cost.  Look at the numbers and modify them if you think they are too high or too low.

Ryan, see this MSA from AIR communities.  Please advise.

 

Ralph/Ali, as you know we have a quick pre-meeting on Monday morning to discuss AIR and the intent of the meeting next Tuesday.  In this Tuesday meeting we will have a data/architecture/security conversation for the mystery shopper program.  

 

The main output of that will be two things:

*	A narrowed security addendum document that fits the POC and MVP – the current one is attached and is very broad and covers everything.  
*	Next steps for a technical deep dive to build the PRD

 

Mike, I don’t currently have you on either of these as it is a purely technical/security-based conversation.  Let me know if you want to join and I will add you.

Kristina here is the response from our tech lead.

 

We have separate production and development environment for all projects . All environments and projects also have dedicated databases . There will be no other customer information or data from any other company in either of these environments except for AIR communities.

 

Let me know if there is anything else Kristina.

 

Enjoy the day.

Hi Dale, I am not sure I understand the question.  Is what to be internal or external?  If you're referring to the description I sent to the marketing team, that is for them to create external deliverables based on the companion app.

I have one quick question - for those that have multiple screens, will the companion app record all audio across any screen? Or will there be a selection process?

Ninja Notes Companion App - Marketing Brief
Executive Summary
We're launching a game-changing feature that transforms our already unique bot-free recording experience from a multi-step process into a single click. This positions us as the simplest AND most private meeting recording solution on the market.
The Feature in Simple Terms
Think of it as a tiny helper that lives quietly on your computer. Once installed (takes 30 seconds), users never have to think about HOW to record again - they just hit RECORD in Ninja Notes and it works. No more screen sharing setup, no more audio selection, no more confusion between Mac and PC differences.
The Before & After Story
BEFORE (Current State):
*	User wants to record a meeting
*	Opens Ninja Notes
*	Initiates Chrome screen share
*	Selects correct tab or screen
*	Ensures ""Share system audio"" is checked
*	Navigates different steps for Mac vs PC
*	Finally starts recording
AFTER (With Companion App):
*	User wants to record a meeting
*	Opens Ninja Notes
*	Clicks RECORD
*	Done.
Value Propositions:
1.	Radically Simple: From 6 steps to 1 step
2.	Set It & Forget It: Install once, works forever
3.	Universal: Same experience on Mac and PC
Suggested Marketing Angles
Simplicity Seeker
*	""One click. Every meeting. Perfect notes.""
*	""Recording meetings just became stupidly simple""
*	""Install once. Click once. Done forever.""
Feature Benefits for Different Audiences
For Technical Minimalists:
*	No more wrestling with browser permissions
*	Works identically across all platforms
*	Zero ongoing maintenance
For Busy Executives:
*	Removes friction from every meeting
*	No training needed for team adoption
*	Consistent experience across all devices
Technical Details for FAQs
*	30-second installation
*	Less than 10MB file size
*	Sits dormant until activated (no battery/resource drain)
*	Optional but highly recommended
*	Available for existing and new users
*	Works with any meeting platform (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, etc.)
Call-to-Action Options
*	""Get the Companion App - Make Recording Effortless""
*	""Upgrade to One-Click Recording""
*	""Install Once, Record Simply""

	Subject: Re: Quote Request - Two AI Product MVPs (MOMeaze App + WisdomOS Platform)

	 

	Hey Dale and Bo,

	 

	Great call Wednesday and we're excited to get started. 

	 

	During our conversation, we covered several key points:

	*	MOMeaze Project Development Strategy: We aligned on a two-phase approach for the Mommies project, starting with a Proof of Concept (POC) by January for investor meetings and Kickstarter, followed by a full MVP for Mother's Day release, with a strong emphasis on modular and adaptable code architecture.
	*	MSA Confirmation: We discussed the need for final confirmation on the Master Services Agreement (MSA) edit, which is crucial for moving forward with all projects. (done!)
	*	Wisdom Project & Funding Estimates: We covered the need for a ""SWAG"" estimate for the Wisdom project, as well as other upcoming projects, to support Ninjaconcepts' $15M funding raise.

	Here are the next steps we agreed upon:

	*	We have confirmed a clean MSA and this will be routed for signature today
	*	We will schedule our meeting for next week to discuss MOMeaze timelines, Wisdom Rates and Timeline estimations, define the QA role + internal product team augmentation. (Invite sent for Nov 4th at 11am CST)
	*	Our most immediate item is defining the SOW for MOMeaze and planning our design phase kickoff date. (Houston for Kayla)

	 

	Best,

	Brandon

		Hey Dale and Bo,

		 

		Great call yesterday. We're excited about MOMeaze. Let's make it happen. 

		 

		We covered several key points during our discussion:

		*	Kayla's vision for the MOMeaze project, including the Mother's Day launch goal and the strategic focus on a Proof of Concept (POC). We'll need to start asap. 
		*	An overview of BairesDev's dedicated team model, our discovery phase approach, and the flexibility offered by time and materials engagements.
		*	Initial discussions regarding the Master Service Agreement (MSA) and the introduction of potential future projects such as QA automation and Wisdom OS. (QA Role and MOMeaze immediate needs, Wisdom trailing a bit behind)
		*	We reviewed the sole MSA edit your team had for Section 2.1. (I had a chance to review this with my team already this morning and for this clause, you are able to cancel if we Breach the contract, we just have a 15 day ""cure"" period to attempt to solve the breached issue. If we can't, you can walk away regardless of the minimum engagement duration. The exact language is under 2.1 - Termination for Breach. This should cover you in case we completely mess up and don't provide what we are supposed to) If you're good with that, can we route MSA for signature while we continue defining SOW?
		*	We also discussed timetracker concerns, which I can address further, waiting on a specific answer internally then I can share

		Regarding our next steps, we will proceed as follows:

		*	For times to meet today, I can only connect at 12pm CST today. I can also meet at 1:30pm CST on Wednesday. I'd suggest Wednesday so 1. Conor can join and 2. We'll make a bit more progress on our side and provide firm rates and lead times to get started
		*	Once we have the SOW signed we can begin planning the Design Phase Kickoff in Houston near Kayla. 

		 

		Best,

		Brandon

					Subject: Re: Quote Request - Two AI Product MVPs (MOMeaze App + WisdomOS Platform) 

					 

					Hey Dale,

					 

					Confirming received. Thanks for sharing. 

					 

					During our conversation, we covered several important topics:

					*	The shift in focus from the Ninja Notes application to two new project ideas: ""MomEaze"" and ""WisdomOS.""
					*	The need for rapid turnaround onbudgetary estimates and enhanced NDA controls for highly unique project concepts.
					*	We'd like to begin getting an MSA/SOW reviewed so we can move quickly on projects Ninja Concepts chooses BairesDev to support. (I will share this by tomorrow) My Vp, @Conor Edward Mccann <mailto:conor.mccann@bairesdev.com>  can help expedite the MSA conversations and we suggest meeting for a call this week to talk through this

					 

					To ensure we move forward efficiently, here are the agreed-upon next steps:

					*	You will send the documents for the MomEaze and Wisdom OS project ideas to me and Melissa. (already shared!)
					*	I will share the documentation we discussed during the meeting with you. (See below) 
					*	Melissa, Conor and myself debriefed after our meeting Friday and would also like to present a standardized rate card for BairesDev that you can use to mix and match requirements and expedite proposal delivery. We can review this and MSA redlines together with @Conor Edward Mccann <mailto:conor.mccann@bairesdev.com> . Could we connect at 11am CST on Friday for this?

					Best,

					Brandon

Hi Tyler.   Great question.  Yes, the companion app captures the ""system"" audio from the computer so it doesn't matter which screen happens to be housing the app producing the sound.  🙂


Thanks,
Mark

That looks awesome Mark! 

I have one quick question - for those that have multiple screens, will the companion app record all audio across any screen? Or will there be a selection process?

Hey guys, this is an overview of the companion app.  Read through it and let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Mark


Ninja Notes Companion App - Marketing Brief
Executive Summary
We're launching a game-changing feature that transforms our already unique bot-free recording experience from a multi-step process into a single click. This positions us as the simplest AND most private meeting recording solution on the market.
The Feature in Simple Terms
Think of it as a tiny helper that lives quietly on your computer. Once installed (takes 30 seconds), users never have to think about HOW to record again - they just hit RECORD in Ninja Notes and it works. No more screen sharing setup, no more audio selection, no more confusion between Mac and PC differences.
The Before & After Story
BEFORE (Current State):

*	User wants to record a meeting
*	Opens Ninja Notes
*	Initiates Chrome screen share
*	Selects correct tab or screen
*	Ensures ""Share system audio"" is checked
*	Navigates different steps for Mac vs PC
*	Finally starts recording

AFTER (With Companion App):

*	User wants to record a meeting
*	Opens Ninja Notes
*	Clicks RECORD
*	Done.

Value Propositions:

1.	
	Radically Simple: From 6 steps to 1 step
2.	Set It & Forget It: Install once, works forever
3.	Universal: Same experience on Mac and PC

Suggested Marketing Angles
Simplicity Seeker

*	""One click. Every meeting. Perfect notes.""
*	""Recording meetings just became stupidly simple""
*	""Install once. Click once. Done forever.""

Feature Benefits for Different Audiences
For Technical Minimalists:

*	No more wrestling with browser permissions
*	Works identically across all platforms
*	Zero ongoing maintenance

For Busy Executives:

*	Removes friction from every meeting
*	No training needed for team adoption
*	Consistent experience across all devices

Technical Details for FAQs

*	30-second installation
*	Less than 10MB file size
*	Sits dormant until activated (no battery/resource drain)
*	Optional but highly recommended
*	Available for existing and new users
*	Works with any meeting platform (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, etc.)

Call-to-Action Options

*	""Get the Companion App - Make Recording Effortless""
*	""Upgrade to One-Click Recording""
*	""Install Once, Record Simply""

"RE: A few more follow up questions","Dale, 

 

Thank you so much for the quick responses and your patience.  

 

I’m attaching our contract forms for a MSA and a security addendum.  Please let me know if you have any questions while you and your team review.  We are open to appropriate edits that capture the realities of the future working relationship, so if something seems off, please raise it!

 

Best,

Dan

Kristina here is the response from our tech lead.

 

We have separate production and development environment for all projects . All environments and projects also have dedicated databases . There will be no other customer information or data from any other company in either of these environments except for AIR communities.

 

Let me know if there is anything else Kristina.

 

Enjoy the day.

Dale,

Hi there! More questions for you from our legal team – do you have or will you have a separate test/dev and production environments for the Tour Intel product? And also, will our data be processed in a separate database/LLM with just data from AIR Communities?

Thanks,

Kristina

We just cut our data warehouse revenue by 40%

TL;DR 	

*	We're now the cheapest data warehouse option at any volume <https://email.posthog.com/e/c/eyJlbWFpbF9pZCI6ImRnVG80UWNEQVA2N0hfMjdId0dhTXdJbHY3SGZ0OVE0c2FBd1c5ND0iLCJocmVmIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9wb3N0aG9nLmNvbS9wcmljaW5nIiwiaW50ZXJuYWwiOiJlOGUxMDcxMWNkMmJmZWJiMWYiLCJsaW5rX2lkIjoxNX0/30d0e56b49c33a6b3f1b85047d6fff7df2b3be01de3e6dbae4df95ec7f885192>  
*	We're now charging the average team 20% less than before 
*	We've added more tiers, making our pricing more fair 
*	We'll give you 7 days of free usage whenever you add a new source 

This is good for you, but will cut our data warehouse revenue by 40%. So, why do it?

We want to do what's right for you
A 7-day free period lets you test things for free. If it works, we think you'll stick around a while. If not, you were going to churn anyway.

We want to be the obvious choice
Our goal is to always undercut competitors. We can do this because we have a lot of products, so the unit economics equal out. More products coming soon! <https://email.posthog.com/e/c/eyJlbWFpbF9pZCI6ImRnVG80UWNEQVA2N0hfMjdId0dhTXdJbHY3SGZ0OVE0c2FBd1c5ND0iLCJocmVmIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcHAucG9zdGhvZy5jb20vc2V0dGluZ3MvdXNlci1mZWF0dXJlLXByZXZpZXdzIiwiaW50ZXJuYWwiOiJlOGUxMDcxMWNkMmJmZWJiMWYiLCJsaW5rX2lkIjo3NTQzfQ/416369fb9c309c5d4af0da42ef53c2281b2e62ea8f73ebb5780ae4e0e160806e> 

We want to build sustainably
Despite the revenue hit, every product we offer is margin-positive and we remain default alive <https://email.posthog.com/e/c/eyJlbWFpbF9pZCI6ImRnVG80UWNEQVA2N0hfMjdId0dhTXdJbHY3SGZ0OVE0c2FBd1c5ND0iLCJocmVmIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9wb3N0aG9nLmNvbS9uZXdzbGV0dGVyL3RoZS1jb21wYW5pZXMtdGhhdC1zaGFwZWQtcG9zdGhvZyNvdXItdGFrZWF3YXlzLTIiLCJpbnRlcm5hbCI6ImU4ZTEwNzExY2QyYmZlYmIxZiIsImxpbmtfaWQiOjg4ODd9/d8a81ae0976401f26d4f7f206ff5e42e455fe945d3306a3fbb77b0dd7a85f967> .

				Latha, 

				Would you be able to do a workup similar to what you did with Wisdom for this opportunity?

				Thanks.


				Kestrel — MVP Executive Summary
				What Kestrel is
				A drone‑imagery and ML platform for residential roofing contractors. Kestrel turns drone photos into point clouds, extracts roof polygons (facets, eaves, ridges, pitch), detects damage, and auto‑generates a bill of materials (BOM) and crew work orders. Translation: faster bids, safer ops, fewer over‑/under‑orders—plus homeowner‑friendly visuals that help close deals. No more roof parkour.
				Why now
				Roofing is a huge, fragmented market with low tech penetration. Existing aerial imagery is periodic and lower resolution; on‑demand drones deliver fresher, higher‑fidelity data. We’re already proving the workflow inside CarbonBlack, giving Kestrel real‑world credibility out of the gate.
________________________________

				Product & Technology

				*	
					Core engines
					
					

					*	
						Measurement model: 3D reconstruction and polygon extraction (areas, lengths, pitch).
					*	
						Damage detection: hail, lifted shingles, cracks; optionally thermal.
					*	
						Materials model: converts measurements to an itemized BOM for ordering and production.
					
					

				*	
					Capture‑agnostic ingestion
					
					

					*	
						Contractor flies their own drone and uploads.
					*	
						3rd‑party network (e.g., pilot marketplaces) dispatched via Kestrel.
					*	
						Kestrel area capture (future): systematic neighborhood/region flights building a licensable imagery/data library.
					
					

				*	
					Build approach
					Use off‑the‑shelf frameworks where practical; train proprietary models and pipelines for roofing‑specific accuracy and robustness.
					
					

________________________________

				Target Customer & Initial Scope

				*	
					Beachhead: U.S. residential roofing contractors (replacement/repair).
				*	
					Why this wedge: High volume, repeatable workflow, clear ROI in sales (win‑rate lift) and production (waste reduction).
				*	
					Adjacencies (later): siding, gutters, windows; international markets where aerial coverage is thin.
					
					

________________________________

				Defensible Advantages

				*	
					Data quality & recency: on‑demand drone imagery beats periodic flyovers for resolution and timeliness.
				*	
					End‑to‑end workflow: measurements + damage + BOM in one system; contractor‑first UX.
				*	
					Proven in the wild: actively used at CarbonBlack for material ordering and work orders.
				*	
					Flexible capture: works with any modern drone and accepts 3rd‑party pilot data; future “imagery‑as‑a‑service” option.
					
					

________________________________

				Go‑to‑Market & Timeline

				*	
					90–120 days: onboard first paying contractors; convert internal CarbonBlack learnings into external MVP.
				*	
					Channels: direct outreach to mid‑size contractors; industry associations & events; integrations with roofing CRMs/estimators; potential distributor/manufacturer partnerships.
				*	
					Geography: start U.S. regions with high storm/hail activity and dense housing stock; expand as references accumulate.
					
					

________________________________

				Business Model (to be validated with pilots)

				*	
					Per‑project fee (easy trial, pass‑through in estimates).
				*	
					SaaS subscription (tiers by usage; API access at higher tiers).
				*	
					Licensing/data access (future): monetize area‑capture imagery and derived roof data to contractors/insurers/solar.
					
					

				Pricing will be tested to capture a portion of quantified ROI: faster bids, higher close rates, fewer material overruns, safer operations.
________________________________

				Market Opportunity (from the source doc)

				*	
					U.S. roofing spend: tens of billions annually; ~100k contractor businesses.
				*	
					Drone inspection segment projected to grow double‑digits over the decade; mature comps (e.g., aerial measurement incumbents) demonstrate large revenue/valuation headroom.
				*	
					Illustrative revenue path (for intuition, not guidance): at 100k reports/year @ $100 each → $10M ARR in U.S. alone, before subscriptions, international, or adjacent trades.
					
					

________________________________

				Use of Funds (6-Month Runway)
				Headline target: ~$650,000 total to deliver an external MVP, secure first paying customers, and demonstrate investor-grade proof points.
				High-Level Allocation

				*	
					Team & Salaries: $431,000
				*	
					Infrastructure & Tools: $70,000
				*	
					Legal / Admin / Insurance: $23,000
				*	
					Marketing, Sales, & Pilot Programs: $45,000
				*	
					Contingency & Working Reserve: $25,000
					Total: ≈ $650,000
					
					

				Sanity Check & Flexibility
				The detailed model fully utilizes the $650K runway.
				If future conditions require tightening to the $550–600K range, the plan can flex in two low-risk ways:

				1.	
					Phase non-critical hires — start Frontend or Customer Success in month 3, reducing spend by $50–70K.
					Fractional or contractor adjustments — use part-time marketing and photogrammetry support, saving $20–30K.


________________________________

				Capitalization & Governance
				Participants & roles

				*	
					Ninja Concepts (incubator & seed capital)
				*	
					Jim Johnson (CSO; Strategic)
				*	
					Cory Shelton (Co‑founder & CEO)
				*	
					Jory Allen (Co‑founder & COO)

________________________________

				120‑Day Milestones & KPIs
				Build

				*	
					External MVP: upload → process → measurements + BOM + shareable report.
				*	
					Accuracy gates: ±2–3% area error vs manual/aerial, >95% auto‑segmentation pass rate on typical roofs.
				*	
					Cycle time: <15 minutes from upload to report (commodity GPU).
					
					

				Commercial

				*	
					5–10 pilot contractors live; ≥50 paid reports processed.
				*	
					Case studies quantifying: bid speedup, close‑rate lift, material over/under‑order reduction.
				*	
					First integrations (CRM/estimator) or distributor/manufacturer referral pilot.
					
					

				Metrics to track
				Report throughput, average turnaround, % auto vs manual review, BOM variance vs actuals, pilot‑to‑paid conversion, gross margin per report, churn/retention for early subs.
________________________________

				Key Risks & Mitigations

				*	
					Edge‑case roofs (complex geometry, occlusions): staged QA workflow; human‑in‑the‑loop for exceptions; targeted data collection.
				*	
					FAA & ops logistics: standardize Part‑107 compliance; lean on 3rd‑party pilot networks early; clear SOPs.
				*	
					Contractor adoption friction: zero‑install uploader, hands‑on onboarding, quick‑win visuals for sales reps.
				*	
					Compute costs: batch/spot GPUs, model distillation, caching, pricing that scales with value delivered.
					
					

________________________________

				The Ask (What this plan funds)

				*	
					Runway: 6 months to external MVP, early revenue, strong reference customers.
				*	
					Team: lean core (ML, backend, frontend, photogrammetry, GTM) plus fractional support.
				*	
					Proof: measurable ROI for contractors and repeatable go‑to‑market motion.
					
					

________________________________

				Open Items to Lock

				1.	
					Capitalization and Governance
				2.	
					Finalize hire phasing to align the detailed budget with the $550–600k target.
				3.	
					Pick two pricing experiments for pilots (e.g., $/report vs. tiered SaaS).

				Confirm pilot geographies and 3–5 lighthouse customers.

The Democrats seem to be flailing for a message—but they may have stumbled onto an intriguing one. As sanitation crews were still cleaning up after the No Kings protests outside the Capitol, Senate Democrats dropped a 76-page report that cuts straight to the center of the economic anxiety defining this era. Its title reads like a campaign slogan and a warning: “The Big Tech Oligarchs’ War Against Workers. <https://substack.com/redirect/0f6a7500-b012-4ca2-8f8b-fe1e4cc6114d?j=eyJ1IjoiNmgxOXdhIn0.oc6YQfctNeoFrygDWdVpcEijyTz6AagcIrYdAHuVuJs> ”

The report, issued by the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee under the leadership of Sen. Bernie Sanders, argues that artificial intelligence and automation are on track to eliminate nearly 100 million American jobs over the next decade. That number is shocking, but the underlying message may be more politically potent: AI is not just an innovation story—it’s a labor story.

While Washington debates whether AI is good or bad for democracy, corporate America has already moved on to the deployment phase. The technology is being integrated everywhere—from logistics to law, marketing to medicine—and its effects are cascading through the labor market in real time. The question isn’t whether AI will change the workforce; it’s how fast, and who will be left standing.

Want to see the future? Look at Amazon. This month alone: 14,000 jobs cut. <https://substack.com/redirect/a87c0485-2996-45c3-9480-0b22df5b7eb7?j=eyJ1IjoiNmgxOXdhIn0.oc6YQfctNeoFrygDWdVpcEijyTz6AagcIrYdAHuVuJs>  Add that to the 27,000 since 2023, and you’ve got a company that’s not struggling—it’s optimizing. Senior VP Beth Galetti sent a memo about staying “nimble” and “strengthening organizations,” which is executive-speak for “the robots are cheaper.”

Amazon’s hiring, too. Thousands of engineers are building AI that handles customer service, writes code, manages logistics, and sells ads. Everything that used to require a person with a headset and a pulse. Call it efficiency if you want. The accountants certainly do.

The Senate report highlights a fact we’ve long been aware of but often overlook: since 1973, worker productivity has increased by 150%, according to their analysis. Corporate profits? Up 370%. Real wages for regular people? Down.

AI isn’t breaking the pattern. It’s turbocharging it.

The Numbers Game


That 100 million figure? The HELP Committee staff fed job descriptions into ChatGPT and asked what could be automated. It’s a projection, not prophecy. Could be high. Could be low. But every serious forecast points in the same general direction.

McKinsey estimates AI could automate 60–70% of the activities employees perform today. Goldman Sachs estimates that 300 million full-time jobs will be affected globally, though they’re quick to add that GDP could increase by 7%, as if that helps the laid-off accountant in Akron. The World Economic Forum splits the difference in its latest report, forecasting 83 million jobs lost and 69 million created by 2027.

Even the optimists admit this won’t be smooth. We covered this at Worth <https://substack.com/redirect/589e963e-85c4-4a78-b357-f90e163b5962?j=eyJ1IjoiNmgxOXdhIn0.oc6YQfctNeoFrygDWdVpcEijyTz6AagcIrYdAHuVuJs>  just a few months ago. “A job is more than just a task,” Rohit Patel from Meta’s Superintelligence Labs told me. “Individual tasks are all AI is capable of right now. I don’t see any sort of job being replaced wholesale in the near term.”

Jim Yu, CEO of BrightEdge, echoes that: “You need to hold AI’s hand—a lot. We’re not replacing people with AI; we’re training AI to help people work faster.”

Sure. For now. However, companies are spending billions to ensure that the hand-holding phase doesn’t last. Every quarter, the loop gets smaller. With every update, the supervision gets lighter. The economics only go one direction.

The International Labor Organization puts it more carefully in a recent analysis: about one in four jobs is “exposed”—meaning chunks of it could vanish tomorrow. Only 2–5% could be fully automated with today’s tech. That sounds reassuring until you remember that we’re still in the early innings, and the people writing the algorithms have every incentive to keep swinging.

MIT economists Daron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo have been tracking this for years. Their research shows automation explains 50–70% of changes in the U.S. wage structure since the 1980s. Not globalization. Not tax policy. Robots and software are replacing jobs while profits accumulate at the top.

AI’s going to make it worse. Those white-collar jobs that felt safe—accountants, paralegals, junior analysts, even coders—they’re all in the crosshairs now. The Senate report, released just weeks ago, throws out numbers: 64% of accounting jobs, 47% of truck-driving jobs, and 80% of administrative roles could be replaced. Perhaps they’re right, perhaps they’re wrong. Either way, nobody’s safe anymore.

For Democrats seeking a message that isn’t just another lecture about democracy or norms, this could be it. Stop talking about AI as if it’s just a tech story. It’s a labor story. It’s about who wins when machines get cheaper than people.

Sanders’ staff wrote the report, but this isn’t just a progressive thing. The same voters who worry about AI taking their jobs also have 401(k)s invested in AI stocks. It’s not left versus right. It’s labor versus capital, just as it ever was, but now it’s faster and shinier.

The HELP Committee’s timing is interesting, too—dropping this report just weeks ago, right as the 2026 midterms come into view. Whether it’s good policy or good politics probably depends on which side of the automation divide you’re standing on.

The Moonshot Proposals


The report recommends a 32-hour workweek, mandatory profit-sharing, and even a “robot tax” to fund retraining programs. None of it will pass, not in this Congress, not in the next one. But it shifts the conversation. It forces CEOs to answer a simple question: If your profits come from firing people, what happens when nobody can afford to buy what you’re selling?

Some executives already get it. The smart ones see AI as an amplifier, not a replacement. Use it to kill the drudgery, free people up for the work that actually matters—strategy, creativity, the stuff machines can’t fake. Not because they’re good people, but because algorithms can’t imagine what comes next. Only humans can do that.

We’ve been here before. The printing press, the steam engine, the assembly line—every revolution promised to free us from toil. And every time, the gains flowed up while the pain spread out. Productivity soared. Wages flatlined. Resentment metastasized.

Maybe this time is different. Maybe we can build a better social contract before the old one collapses completely. But that is not the direction we are heading in.

As I write this, some 41.5 million Americans are on the verge of losing their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, aka SNAP, benefits. That is 12.3% of the U.S. population, or nearly one in eight Americans, most of whom are children and older adults. This, of course, has nothing to do with AI or economic policy, but it shows how frayed the social contract has become.

"Re: Ninja Notes Companion App","That looks awesome Mark! 

I have one quick question - for those that have multiple screens, will the companion app record all audio across any screen? Or will there be a selection process?

Subject: Ninja Notes Companion App 
 
Hey guys, this is an overview of the companion app.  Read through it and let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Mark


Ninja Notes Companion App - Marketing Brief
Executive Summary
We're launching a game-changing feature that transforms our already unique bot-free recording experience from a multi-step process into a single click. This positions us as the simplest AND most private meeting recording solution on the market.
The Feature in Simple Terms
Think of it as a tiny helper that lives quietly on your computer. Once installed (takes 30 seconds), users never have to think about HOW to record again - they just hit RECORD in Ninja Notes and it works. No more screen sharing setup, no more audio selection, no more confusion between Mac and PC differences.
The Before & After Story
BEFORE (Current State):

*	User wants to record a meeting
*	Opens Ninja Notes
*	Initiates Chrome screen share
*	Selects correct tab or screen
*	Ensures ""Share system audio"" is checked
*	Navigates different steps for Mac vs PC
*	Finally starts recording

AFTER (With Companion App):

*	User wants to record a meeting
*	Opens Ninja Notes
*	Clicks RECORD
*	Done.

Value Propositions:

1.	
	Radically Simple: From 6 steps to 1 step
2.	Set It & Forget It: Install once, works forever
3.	Universal: Same experience on Mac and PC

Suggested Marketing Angles
Simplicity Seeker

*	""One click. Every meeting. Perfect notes.""
*	""Recording meetings just became stupidly simple""
*	""Install once. Click once. Done forever.""

Feature Benefits for Different Audiences
For Technical Minimalists:

*	No more wrestling with browser permissions
*	Works identically across all platforms
*	Zero ongoing maintenance

For Busy Executives:

*	Removes friction from every meeting
*	No training needed for team adoption
*	Consistent experience across all devices

Technical Details for FAQs

*	30-second installation
*	Less than 10MB file size
*	Sits dormant until activated (no battery/resource drain)
*	Optional but highly recommended
*	Available for existing and new users
*	Works with any meeting platform (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, etc.)

Call-to-Action Options

*	""Get the Companion App - Make Recording Effortless""
*	""Upgrade to One-Click Recording""
*	""Install Once, Record Simply""

"Re: Ninja Notes Companion App","Hi Tyler.   Great question.  Yes, the companion app captures the ""system"" audio from the computer so it doesn't matter which screen happens to be housing the app producing the sound.  🙂

That looks awesome Mark! 

I have one quick question - for those that have multiple screens, will the companion app record all audio across any screen? Or will there be a selection process?

Hey guys, this is an overview of the companion app.  Read through it and let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Ninja Notes Companion App - Marketing Brief
Executive Summary
We're launching a game-changing feature that transforms our already unique bot-free recording experience from a multi-step process into a single click. This positions us as the simplest AND most private meeting recording solution on the market.
The Feature in Simple Terms
Think of it as a tiny helper that lives quietly on your computer. Once installed (takes 30 seconds), users never have to think about HOW to record again - they just hit RECORD in Ninja Notes and it works. No more screen sharing setup, no more audio selection, no more confusion between Mac and PC differences.
The Before & After Story
BEFORE (Current State):

*	User wants to record a meeting
*	Opens Ninja Notes

*	Finally starts recording

AFTER (With Companion App):

*	User wants to record a meeting
*	Opens Ninja Notes

"Internal Review – Current State of Product Architecture Documentation","Hi Ali, I’d like to get a clearer picture of where we stand with our technical and architecture documentation across all Ninja Concepts platforms (Ninja Notes, Omni, Sona, and others). The intent here isn’t to create documentation work — it’s to understand what documentation already exists, what’s current, and where we might have gaps. This will help us plan for stronger consistency and modularity across products as we continue to grow.

 

If these artifacts already exist (in repos, Miro, Notion, Confluence, etc.), a link list per platform is perfect. If something doesn’t exist, just note it briefly — no need to create new docs right now.

 

Our goal is to come away with a snapshot of our current documentation maturity:

*	What’s complete and current
*	What’s missing or inconsistent
*	What we should prioritize next for standardization

 

Could you give me a timeline as to when this could be pulled together?


Once we have this initial view, we can discuss the best way to fill any documentation gaps moving forward. Possibly part of our Bairesdev augmentation work.

 

Thanks for taking the time on this — it will give us much clearer visibility into how our platforms are structured today and where we can make future updates more seamless.

 

 

Best,
Dale Johnson

Subject: Re: Quote Request - Two AI Product MVPs (MOMeaze App + WisdomOS Platform)

 

Hey Dale and Bo,

 

Great call Wednesday and we're excited to get started. 

 

During our conversation, we covered several key points:

*	MOMeaze Project Development Strategy: We aligned on a two-phase approach for the Mommies project, starting with a Proof of Concept (POC) by January for investor meetings and Kickstarter, followed by a full MVP for Mother's Day release, with a strong emphasis on modular and adaptable code architecture.
*	MSA Confirmation: We discussed the need for final confirmation on the Master Services Agreement (MSA) edit, which is crucial for moving forward with all projects. (done!)
*	Wisdom Project & Funding Estimates: We covered the need for a ""SWAG"" estimate for the Wisdom project, as well as other upcoming projects, to support Ninjaconcepts' $15M funding raise.

Here are the next steps we agreed upon:

*	We have confirmed a clean MSA and this will be routed for signature today
*	We will schedule our meeting for next week to discuss MOMeaze timelines, Wisdom Rates and Timeline estimations, define the QA role + internal product team augmentation. (Invite sent for Nov 4th at 11am CST)
*	Our most immediate item is defining the SOW for MOMeaze and planning our design phase kickoff date. (Houston for Kayla)

 

Best,

Brandon

	Hey Dale and Bo,

	 

	Great call yesterday. We're excited about MOMeaze. Let's make it happen. 

	 

	We covered several key points during our discussion:

	*	Kayla's vision for the MOMeaze project, including the Mother's Day launch goal and the strategic focus on a Proof of Concept (POC). We'll need to start asap. 
	*	An overview of BairesDev's dedicated team model, our discovery phase approach, and the flexibility offered by time and materials engagements.
	*	Initial discussions regarding the Master Service Agreement (MSA) and the introduction of potential future projects such as QA automation and Wisdom OS. (QA Role and MOMeaze immediate needs, Wisdom trailing a bit behind)
	*	We reviewed the sole MSA edit your team had for Section 2.1. (I had a chance to review this with my team already this morning and for this clause, you are able to cancel if we Breach the contract, we just have a 15 day ""cure"" period to attempt to solve the breached issue. If we can't, you can walk away regardless of the minimum engagement duration. The exact language is under 2.1 - Termination for Breach. This should cover you in case we completely mess up and don't provide what we are supposed to) If you're good with that, can we route MSA for signature while we continue defining SOW?
	*	We also discussed timetracker concerns, which I can address further, waiting on a specific answer internally then I can share

	Regarding our next steps, we will proceed as follows:

	*	For times to meet today, I can only connect at 12pm CST today. I can also meet at 1:30pm CST on Wednesday. I'd suggest Wednesday so 1. Conor can join and 2. We'll make a bit more progress on our side and provide firm rates and lead times to get started
	*	Once we have the SOW signed we can begin planning the Design Phase Kickoff in Houston near Kayla. 

	 

	Best,

	Brandon

					Hey Dale,

					 

					Confirming received. Thanks for sharing. 

					 

					During our conversation, we covered several important topics:

					*	The shift in focus from the Ninja Notes application to two new project ideas: ""MomEaze"" and ""WisdomOS.""
					*	The need for rapid turnaround onbudgetary estimates and enhanced NDA controls for highly unique project concepts.
					*	We'd like to begin getting an MSA/SOW reviewed so we can move quickly on projects Ninja Concepts chooses BairesDev to support. (I will share this by tomorrow) My Vp, @Conor Edward Mccann <mailto:conor.mccann@bairesdev.com>  can help expedite the MSA conversations and we suggest meeting for a call this week to talk through this

					 

					To ensure we move forward efficiently, here are the agreed-upon next steps:

					*	You will send the documents for the MomEaze and Wisdom OS project ideas to me and Melissa. (already shared!)
					*	I will share the documentation we discussed during the meeting with you. (See below) 
					*	Melissa, Conor and myself debriefed after our meeting Friday and would also like to present a standardized rate card for BairesDev that you can use to mix and match requirements and expedite proposal delivery. We can review this and MSA redlines together with @Conor Edward Mccann <mailto:conor.mccann@bairesdev.com> . Could we connect at 11am CST on Friday for this?

					Best,

					Brandon

That looks awesome Mark! 

I have one quick question - for those that have multiple screens, will the companion app record all audio across any screen? Or will there be a selection process?

Hey guys, this is an overview of the companion app.  Read through it and let me know if you have any questions.

 

Thanks,

Ninja Notes Companion App - Marketing Brief

Executive Summary

We're launching a game-changing feature that transforms our already unique bot-free recording experience from a multi-step process into a single click. This positions us as the simplest AND most private meeting recording solution on the market.

The Feature in Simple Terms

Think of it as a tiny helper that lives quietly on your computer. Once installed (takes 30 seconds), users never have to think about HOW to record again - they just hit RECORD in Ninja Notes and it works. No more screen sharing setup, no more audio selection, no more confusion between Mac and PC differences.

The Before & After Story

BEFORE (Current State):

*	User wants to record a meeting
*	Opens Ninja Notes
*	Initiates Chrome screen share
*	Selects correct tab or screen
*	Ensures ""Share system audio"" is checked
*	Navigates different steps for Mac vs PC
*	Finally starts recording

AFTER (With Companion App):

*	User wants to record a meeting
*	Opens Ninja Notes
*	Clicks RECORD
*	Done.

Value Propositions:

1.	Radically Simple: From 6 steps to 1 step

2.	Set It & Forget It: Install once, works forever
3.	Universal: Same experience on Mac and PC

Suggested Marketing Angles

Simplicity Seeker

*	""One click. Every meeting. Perfect notes.""
*	""Recording meetings just became stupidly simple""
*	""Install once. Click once. Done forever.""

Feature Benefits for Different Audiences

For Technical Minimalists:

*	No more wrestling with browser permissions
*	Works identically across all platforms
*	Zero ongoing maintenance

For Busy Executives:

*	Removes friction from every meeting
*	No training needed for team adoption
*	Consistent experience across all devices

Technical Details for FAQs

*	30-second installation
*	Less than 10MB file size
*	Sits dormant until activated (no battery/resource drain)
*	Optional but highly recommended
*	Available for existing and new users
*	Works with any meeting platform (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, etc.)

Call-to-Action Options

*	""Get the Companion App - Make Recording Effortless""
*	""Upgrade to One-Click Recording""
*	""Install Once, Record Simply""

"FW: A few more follow up questions","Ryan, see this MSA from AIR communities.  Please advise.

 

Ralph/Ali, as you know we have a quick pre-meeting on Monday morning to discuss AIR and the intent of the meeting next Tuesday.  In this Tuesday meeting we will have a data/architecture/security conversation for the mystery shopper program.  

 

The main output of that will be two things:

*	A narrowed security addendum document that fits the POC and MVP – the current one is attached and is very broad and covers everything.  
*	Next steps for a technical deep dive to build the PRD

 

Mike, I don’t currently have you on either of these as it is a purely technical/security-based conversation.  Let me know if you want to join and I will add you.

Kristina here is the response from our tech lead.

 

We have separate production and development environment for all projects . All environments and projects also have dedicated databases . There will be no other customer information or data from any other company in either of these environments except for AIR communities.

 

Let me know if there is anything else Kristina.

Dale,

Hi there! More questions for you from our legal team – do you have or will you have a separate test/dev and production environments for the Tour Intel product? And also, will our data be processed in a separate database/LLM with just data from AIR Communities?

Thanks,

Kristina

"RE: A few more follow up questions","Hi Dan thanks so much for this.  I will have our legal team look at it and come back with any questions.  

 

The security addendum is something that I know will have to be rescoped based on this specific work effort as the scope for it currently is all encompassing and a lot of it does not apply to our work specifically.  One of our goals for the meeting next week is to scope the data that we will be capturing and how the data is managed so we can write a security addendum that will satisfy AIR communities CISO. 

 

Let me get to work on this first part. 

 

All for now.

 

Dale

Dale, 

 

Thank you so much for the quick responses and your patience.  

 

I’m attaching our contract forms for a MSA and a security addendum.  Please let me know if you have any questions while you and your team review.  We are open to appropriate edits that capture the realities of the future working relationship, so if something seems off, please raise it!

 

Best,

Dan
