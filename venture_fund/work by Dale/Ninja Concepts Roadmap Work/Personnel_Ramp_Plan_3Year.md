## Risk Factors & Mitigation

### Hiring Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Can't hire fast enough (43 hires in 2028)** | Medium (40%) | High | Recruiting agency partnerships, employee referrals ($5K-$10K bonus), remote-first (global talent pool) |
| **Key person turnover (VP-level)** | Low-Medium (25%) | High | Competitive comp (top 25% market), equity (vesting over 4 years), career growth opportunities |
| **India team communication/quality issues** | Medium (35%) | Medium | Daily standups, overlap hours (US morning = India evening), US senior engineers mentor India team |
| **Salary inflation (tech downturn → upturn)** | Medium (40%) | Medium | Annual comp reviews (3-5% increases), equity upside, lock in hires early in year |

---

### Budget Management

**Burn Rate Control**:
- **2026**: Tight control, defer non-critical hires if revenue lags
- **2027**: Series A capital deployed, accelerate hiring
- **2028**: Revenue > Payroll, sustainable growth

**Contingency Plan**:
- If revenue < 80% of plan by Q2 2026, **defer 5-8 hires** (save $500K-$800K)
- If Series A delayed, **bridge financing** ($500K-$750K) to extend runway
- If product-market fit not achieved, **cut Sona/Concierge** (reallocate 10-15 FTEs to core products)
