## Strategic Guidance for Investors

### **Sona: High Risk, High Reward**

**Upside**:
- $15B wearable AI market, 40% CAGR
- Differentiation vs. consumer wearables (enterprise, compliance, ecosystem)
- Recurring revenue model (hardware + subscription)

**Downside**:
- Capital intensive ($1M-$2M inventory by 2028)
- Hardware risks (supply chain, defects, regulatory)
- Competition from Apple, Meta (well-funded)

**Recommendation**: 
- **Proceed cautiously** with Series A capital
- **Decision point Q4 2026**: If alpha feedback negative, cancel
- **Risk tolerance**: 30-40% probability of success

---

### **Omni Concierge: Strategic Option, Low Priority**

**Upside**:
- $6B event/retail engagement market
- Leverage existing Omni platform (low incremental dev cost)
- Usage-based model = low customer risk

**Downside**:
- Niche market (events = episodic, retail adoption slow)
- Human staff preference (cultural resistance)
- Low margins (hardware + support costs)

**Recommendation**:
- **Launch in 2027** only if Omni Sales/Service successful
- **Decision point Q2 2028**: If <50 locations, cancel
- **Risk tolerance**: 50% probability of success

---

## Conclusion

**Sona** and **Omni Concierge** are **expansion products** - higher risk, but provide optionality and market diversification. They should not distract from core products (Ninja Notes, Omni Sales/Service) which drive 80%+ of revenue through 2028.

**Portfolio Strategy**: "Nail it, then scale it"
1. **2026-2027**: Prove Ninja Notes + Omni Sales/Service ($10M+ ARR)
2. **2027-2028**: Launch Sona + Omni Concierge (with Series A capital)
3. **2028+**: Scale winners, cut losers

**Critical Decision Points**:
- **Q4 2026**: Sona go/no-go (based on alpha feedback)
- **Q2 2028**: Omni Concierge go/no-go (based on beta traction)
