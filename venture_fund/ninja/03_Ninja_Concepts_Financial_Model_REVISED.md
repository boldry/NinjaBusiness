- Conversion cap: $10M (vs. $5M round valuation)
- Discount: 20% on $5M = $4M effective price
- **Debt converts at lower of:**
  - $10M cap → 9.6% equity ($960K / $10M)
  - $4M discounted → 24% equity ($960K / $4M)

| **2029** | 70 | 157 | 40 | 6,280 | $502K | $2M | **$8.02M** |
| **2030** | 100 | 257 | 42 | 10,794 | $864K | $2.8M | **$13.16M** |

**Assumptions:**
- New customer growth: Conservative ramp (5 → 12 → 28 → 42 customers per year)
- Deployment size grows: 27 → 42 users average (customers expand usage over time)
- Churn: 8% annual (high switching costs once deployed)
- Upsell rate: 20-30% annual user growth per customer (expansion within accounts)
- Setup fee captured: 90% (some customers negotiate multi-year deals with reduced setup)

#### 3.2.4 Omni Revenue Summary

| Year | Customers | Total Users | Subscription Revenue | Setup Fees | Total Revenue | YoY Growth |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| **2025** (Q4) | 5 | 135 | $32K | $125K | $157K | - |
| **2026** | 17 | 544 | $522K | $325K | $847K | 440% |
| **2027** | 45 | 1,575 | $1.51M | $800K | $2.31M | 173% |
| **2028** | 87 | 3,306 | $3.17M | $1.2M | $4.37M | 89% |
| **2029** | 157 | 6,280 | $6.03M | $2M | $8.03M | 84% |
| **2030** | 257 | 10,794 | $10.36M | $2.8M | $13.16M | 64% |

**Key Metric: Setup Fees Trend**
- Setup fees as % of total revenue decline over time: 79% (2025 Q4) → 21% (2030)
- This is healthy - shows recurring revenue base growing
- Year 3+: Subscription revenue exceeds setup fees (predictable, recurring)

### 3.3 Sona (Wearable AI Assistant)

- Integration with Ninja Notes and Omni Suite (ecosystem play)
- Privacy-first (on-device processing, no cloud by default)
- Ruggedized for field environments (IP67, drop-resistant)
- 24-hour battery life (vs. 4-6 hours for competitors)

#### 3.3.2 Revenue Projections

| Year | Devices Sold | Hardware Revenue | Avg Active Devices | Subscription Revenue | Total Revenue |
|------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **2026** | 250 | $137K | 125 | $37K | $174K |
| **2027** | 1,500 | $824K | 1,625 | $975K | $1.8M |

| **2029** | 8,000 | $4.4M | 12,625 | $7.58M | $11.98M |
| **2030** | 12,000 | $6.6M | 23,625 | $14.18M | $20.78M |

**Assumptions:**
- Hardware price: $550 average (some enterprise discounts)
- Subscription: $60/month average ($720/year)
- Subscription churn: 12% annual (device loss, role change, competitive pressure)
- Manufacturing ramp: Q2 2027 commercial launch, scale in 2028-2029

**Risk Factors:**
- Hardware supply chain (6-12 month lead times)
- Regulatory (FCC, CE marking for wearables)
- Competition (Apple, Meta could enter space)
- Capital intensive (inventory, tooling = $500K-$1M investment)

**Decision Point:** Defer Sona commercial launch to 2027 (post-Series A) to preserve Seed capital for Ninja Notes and Omni.

### 3.4 Omni Concierge (AI Kiosk/Event Assistant)

#### 3.4.1 Pricing & Model (Usage-Based)

**Pricing:**
- $7.50 per talk hour (voice interaction time)
- Hardware kiosk: $3,000-$8,000 (optional, can be customer-owned or leased)

**Typical Usage Scenarios:**

| Use Case | Talk Hours/Month | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost | Hardware |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|----------|

1. **Usage-only:** Customer owns hardware, pays per talk hour
2. **Lease + usage:** Ninja leases hardware ($200/month) + $7.50/hour
3. **Hardware sale + usage:** Customer buys kiosk upfront, pays usage ongoing

**Target Markets:**
- Event venues (conferences, trade shows, conventions)
- Retail (mall kiosks, store concierges, product recommendations)
- Hospitality (hotel lobbies, resorts, airports)
- Corporate (office lobbies, visitor management)
- Education (campus information, wayfinding)

| **Rule of 40** | -54% | 53% | 88% | 101% | 115% | 113% | 40%+ healthy |

**Analysis:**
- **Exceptional LTV/CAC**: 11:1 → 627:1 (channel model + viral growth = very low CAC)
- **Fast Payback**: 8 → 1.5 months (vs. 12-18 typical enterprise SaaS)
- **Strong NRR**: 110-145% (expansion revenue from upsells, more seats, more products)
- **Rule of 40**: Achieved in Year 1, 100%+ by Year 3 (world-class)

**Note**: LTV/CAC ratios >100:1 in later years driven by viral/channel CAC near zero. Conservative to assume some CAC floor.

## 9. Funding Strategy & Scenarios

### 9.1 Current Round: Seed ($1.25M, Q4 2025)

**Status**: Closing Q4 2025
**Already covered in Section 2** - See 2.1 for terms, 2.3 for use of funds, 2.4 for cap table

**Runway Analysis:**
- **Funding close**: October 2025 with $1.25M
- **Monthly burn (post-funding)**: $180K-$220K (ramps as hiring accelerates)
- **Average burn**: $200K/month
- **Gross runway**: 6.25 months (to April 2026)
- **Revenue ramp**: $315K (Q4 2025) → $1.44M (Q4 2026)
- **Net burn**: Decreases from $180K/month to $100K/month by Q4 2026
- **Effective runway**: 12-14 months to break-even cash flow (Q4 2026 - Q1 2027)

**Risk**: Tight runway. Mitigation options:
1. **Revenue acceleration**: Push for $2M MRR by Q3 2026 (vs. $1.2M modeled)
2. **Cost discipline**: Defer 2-3 hires to Q2-Q3 2026 (save $150K)
3. **Bridge financing**: Line up $500K bridge for Q2 2026 if revenue lags
4. **Early Series A**: Begin fundraising in Q3 2026 (vs. Q4 2027)

### 9.2 Bridge Scenario (Q2 2026 - If Needed)

## 11. Conclusion & Investment Thesis

### 11.1 Why Invest in Ninja Concepts?

**1. Massive Market Opportunity ($286.5B TAM)**
- AI productivity tools: $43.5B TAM, 26-40% CAGR
- Enterprise services: $243B TAM, 15-28% CAGR
- Multiple products across high-growth segments

**2. Proven Team with Exits & $1B+ Launches**
- Bo Thompson: CEO with successful M&A exit experience
- Dale Johnson: CPO with $1B+ product launches at HP/Xerox (HP partnership already engaged)
- Not first-time founders learning on investor capital

**3. Unique Channel/Partnership GTM**
- HP partnership (30% of users, low CAC)
- Reseller/VAR network (40% of users, scalable)
- Direct PLG (30% of users, high margin)
- **Blended CAC: $36/user** (vs. $5K+ for enterprise direct sales)

**4. Exceptional Unit Economics**
- LTV/CAC: 11:1 → 627:1 (channel model drives CAC near zero)
- Gross margins: 73-76% (best-in-class for mixed model)
- CAC payback: 1.5-8 months (vs. 12-18 months typical)
- Net Revenue Retention: 110-145% (expansion revenue drives growth)

**5. Fast Path to Profitability**
- Cash flow positive: Q4 2026 - Q1 2027 (18 months post-funding)
- EBITDA positive: Q2 2027 (21 months)
- Net income positive: Q4 2027 (24 months)
- 20%+ net margins by 2028

**6. Multiple Revenue Streams = Diversification**
- 5 products + 4 services = 9 revenue streams
- Reduces risk vs. single-product companies
- Cross-sell opportunities (services → products, products → services)

**7. Exceptional Returns Potential**
- Expected return: $51.5M (41x on $1.25M)
- Conservative exit (2029): $258M = 31x
- Base case exit (2030): $490M = 59x
- Optimistic exit (2030): $700M = 84x
- IPO scenario (2031+): $1.4B+ = 173x

### 11.2 Investment Risks (Balanced View)

**Challenges:**
1. Tight runway in Year 1 (may need $500K bridge in Q2 2026)
2. Dependence on HP partnership (if underperforms, direct sales harder)
3. Execution risk (building 5 products + 4 services simultaneously is complex)
4. Competition from Microsoft/Google/Salesforce (bundling threat)

**Mitigation:**
- Conservative financial model already assumes slower growth
- Services division provides cash bridge while products ramp
- Experienced team with proven track record
- Multiple paths to success (any 2 of 5 products hitting = company succeeds)

### 11.3 Investment Decision Framework

**For Seed Investors:**

**Invest IF:**
- ✅ Believe in AI productivity market growth (26-40% CAGR)
- ✅ Trust team execution (Bo exit, Dale $1B launches)
- ✅ Comfortable with 18-month path to cash flow positive
- ✅ See value in channel/partnership GTM (HP relationship)
- ✅ Want exposure to multiple AI product categories
- ✅ Acceptable risk-adjusted return (41x expected, 31-84x range)

**Pass IF:**
- ❌ Concerned about runway (Year 1 burn rate high)
- ❌ Skeptical of HP partnership materiality
- ❌ Prefer pure SaaS (not mixed products/services)
- ❌ Want immediate revenue traction (company is pre-revenue at funding)
- ❌ Uncomfortable with multi-product complexity

### 11.4 Recommended Investment: **STRONG YES**

**At $1.25M for 20% equity ($5M pre-money):**

| Factor | Assessment | Weight | Score |
|--------|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Market Opportunity** | Massive ($286B TAM), high growth | 25% | 9/10 |
| **Team Quality** | Proven (exit + $1B launches) | 25% | 9/10 |
| **Product/GTM Differentiation** | Strong (channel model, multi-product) | 20% | 8/10 |
| **Unit Economics** | Exceptional (LTV/CAC 627:1, 73% margins) | 15% | 10/10 |
| **Financials & Execution** | Good (cash flow positive in 18mo, realistic plan) | 10% | 7/10 |
| **Risk/Reward** | Excellent (41x expected, 31-173x range) | 5% | 9/10 |
| **Total Weighted Score** | | **100%** | **8.65/10** |

**Verdict**: **Strong investment opportunity** at Seed stage. Team, market, and unit economics are exceptional. Runway risk is manageable with bridge option. Expected 41x return with 31-84x range is compelling for early-stage VC.
