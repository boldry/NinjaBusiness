## Questions to Answer Before We Start

Before I begin researching, please confirm:

1. **Geographic Focus**: Are we targeting US-only, North America, or Global for SAM calculation?
2. **Timeframe**: Should projections focus on 3-year (2025-2028) or 5-year (2025-2030)?
3. **Customer Segment Priority**: Which is primary focus - Enterprise (1000+ employees), Mid-market (500-1000), or Both?
4. **Venture Studio Model**: Should we include venture studio revenue projections in TAM or keep separate?
5. **Data Access**: Do you have access to Gartner, Forrester, or other paid reports? Or should I rely on public sources?

**Please answer these and I'll begin systematic research immediately.**
